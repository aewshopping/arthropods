### Headmaster Professor Slumblebore's hints on exploring Hogsnorts and investigating the dungeons

Quillus startus. Hello? Hello? Is this working? I'm recording my voice onto paper using magic: with my own spell in fact, which I'm rather proud of. 

Arthur, I am writing this message to help you get through the school and find your way to the dungeons where there is something rather strange going on. You need to get to the bottom of it. And if there is any foul play going on down there, you must clean it up.

Your professors will teach you some essential spells to help you overcome the challenges you will face. But you will have to talk to them carefully to make sure that they don't get distracted in their lessons.

- Professor Comicus Jape is an excellent teacher of offensive magic but he can get distracted by telling jokes. If you ignore his jokes, he can teach you a very useful spell to transform your wand into a magic sword that can cut through anything. 

- Professor Madam Blavatksy knows an extremely useful sleeping spell. However you must be patient and humble. If you show her that you do not pretend to know all the answers, she will help you and teach you her sleeping enchantment. 

- Professor Eric Knid is a rather peculiar fellow to tell you the truth. But he does know a marvellous flamethrower spell, which I myself have used to roast marshmallows. Just make sure you don't get him started on his favourite topic: why insects are so amazing, otherwise he will forget all about teaching you magic.

You can find the dungeon by sneaking off into the school at night time after dinner. Or by creeping off into the school after your lessons, or after you bunk off for the day.

To open the door to the dungeon you will need the magic password. Come and see me in my office at night time and I will tell you what it is. 

Finally, do not be afraid!

Whatever choices you make you will never be in a situation you cannot get out of. And you will not get into trouble whatever you do. I am relying on you to save the school and you may need to break a few rules.

That is all I wanted to tell you Arthur - good luck! Quill stop. Magicus stoppus. Stop writing. Just stop it! Why isn't this thing stopping? Ah I remember now: quillus stoppus.
