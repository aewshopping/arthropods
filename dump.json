Now that you are looking good in your pointy wizard hat, you want to get your hands on a wand as soon as possible and start doing some real magic!\n\nThe sign above Wally's shop is a giant wand dangling from a chain above the shop door. It swings gently to and fro even though there is no breeze to speak of, and little crackles of electric-gold magic arc over its surface.\n\nYou can't help thinking that this wand must also double up as Wally's security system.\n\nWith a nervous glance upwards you and your Mum enter the shop.\n\nThe inside is sparklingly clean and glass cabinets are artfully arranged around the shop. Each cabinet contains three or four magic wands, resting on little red cushions with gold tassles. It all looks _very_ expensive.\n\n\"Arthur are you sure this is the only wand shop?\" asks your mum. \"Perhaps there is another one that is not quite so err... so un...\"\n\n\"Welcome!\" a smooth rich voice startles them from the back of the room. \"Welcome to Wally's Wanderful Wand shop! And madam I can assure you that this is the only wand shop in Hippoto Mews. But fear not I'm sure we can find a wand that is the perfect match for young Arthur.\"\n\n\"How did you know my name?\" you ask in surprise.\n\n\"One of the many branches of magic in which I am an expert, young Arthur, is mind reading. Just by looking into your eyes I can see the entire contents of your brain. I can also do it by looking in your ears, in your mouth, up your nose... any hole works to tell the truth. But I usually prefer the eyes. Also your Mum called you Arthur when you entered my shop.\"\n\n\"And you are Wally I suppose?\" says your Mum.\n\n\"I am indeed, dear madam. Did you divine this from looking in my ear hole? Remarkable!\"\n\n\"No I figured it out when you said this was your shop.\"\n\n\"Quite so. We are all mind-readers to some degree.\"\n\n\"Mr Wally\" you interrupt \"can I have a wand please?\"\n\n\"No you cannot have _a_ wand Arthur. But what you can have is _the_ wand. Every wand is unique! You are unique! You require the exact match for your particular thaumaturgical resonance. Your thaumaturgic twin as it were. The most powerful - the only! - tool you will ever need as a magician.\"\n\n\"That sounds nice,\" says your Mum, \"but we don't want anything _too_ fancy. The thing is we don't have much, or in fact any, wizard money. Frigates I mean.\"\n\n\"The wand is of course priceless. I do offer a 10% discount for Hogsnorts' students in their first year. But for you I will increase this discount to 100% if - if! - Arthur and I can establish a true connection of minds, and I can see that you Arthur are a worthy wandholder.\"\n\n\"A 100% discount you say? That's a good deal. Arthur see if you can connect up your mind with Wally's love.\" your Mum suggests.\n\nWally crouches down in front of you and holds your ears gently but firmly forcing you to look deep into his blue grey eyes. At first nothing happens. But after just a few moments you get the strange sensation of being _pulled_  towards his eyeballs; his black pupils feel like they are _dragging_ you inwards.\n\n\"Good Arthur, very good!\" says Wally. \"I believe that the magical connection between our minds is now established, and astonishingly quickly too! You must have deep reserves of magic.\n\n\"Arthur I need you to think of a number. If I can read your mind and tell you the number you were thinking of this will be proof that the magical mind connection is working properly.\n\n\"First I need you to think of a number between 1 and 10. But don't tell me what it is! Have you got one?\"\n\nYou think of a number and nod your head.\n\n\"Now\" says Wally, \"I need you to multiply this number by 9. 9 is a number with strong magical properties\" he explains.\n\nYou multiply your number by 9.\n\n\"The next step\" he says, \"is to split your answer into the two digits and add those two digits together. For example if your answer is 13 (and I know it is not!) then you would split it into 1 and 3, then add that 1 and 3 together, so 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n\"Ok\" you say as you do the sum in your head.\n\n\"Now take that answer and multiply it by 6. Can you do that?\"\n\n\"Yes\" you reply.\n\n\"Now turn to that number!

I mean, do you know the way?\"\n\n\"How hard can it be?\" says Robert, getting out his wand. \"We just follow the train. _Autopilotus stoppus!_\"\n\nWith that, the car gave a little cough and a splutter, went silent, and gently started a death dive to the ground far below. \n\n\"Aaaargh Robert, what have you done?!\" yells Aaron. \"Turn it back on!!\"\n\n\"Hmmm which one is the 'engine on' button?\" muses Robert as the car bursts downwards through the clouds, the shrieking wind all around them.\n\nYou are dry mouthed with fear, trying desperately not to scream as Robert calmly tries the different buttons on the car dashboard.\n\n\"Not this one... no... not that one either... Aha! There we go!\" the car engine starts again, and the vehicle begins to spiral crazily as Robert pulls hard on the steering wheel to bring it back under control.\n\nJust then you see something so amazing it makes you forget even your impending splatter on the ground below.\n\nA mile or two away a colossal stone building stands at the top of a grassy hill. Towers sprout from the building like mushrooms, spiralling outwards at crazy angles. The roofs are studded with battlements. The walls are encrusted with beautiful stained glass windows. And over it all hangs a faint golden glow of pure magic. Hogsnorts School of Magic.\n\n\"Watch out Robert, flying monkeys below!\" shouts out Alex. \n\nYou tear your eyes away from the building. Unbelievably Alex is right: a flock of flying monkeys is directly in your path. It is hard to make out but the flying monkeys appear to be carrying people...\n\nThe monkeys scatter in all directions as the car zooms through the middle of them, and you just have time to make out that each pair of flying monkeys is carrying a young witch or wizard. You realise that for some insane reason the flying monkeys are transporting the children to the school. \n\n\"Sorry!\" shouts Robert out of the window at the monkeys, still wrestling with the steering wheel. \n\nHe just manages to bring it under control in time to make a very bumpy landing on the Hogsnorts school lawn.\n\nYou lean back in the car, your breath coming in short panicky bursts.

You have hidden but powerful magical abilities :-)_\n\n_As a new student you will need to bring the following items on your first day:_\n\n_- a magic wand_  \n_- a wizard's robe and hat_  \n_- a year-1 spellbook_  \n\n_They can be purchased from the magical shops located on the magical street Hippoto Mews, London, just behind Gutter Lane._\n\n_Term will start on 1 September. Please come to Leeds Railway Station, from where the Hogsnorts Express will depart at 9.34 precisely._\n\n_Yours resplendently,  \nZebediah Slumblebore  \nHeadmaster  \nHogsnorts School_\n\n_P.S. Remember the secret code to enter Hippoto Mews is: TAP TAP TAP... TAP._\n\n_P.P.S. Note that due to the alarming recent magical disturbances at the school, the parents of all pupils are required to sign a \"child's demise liability waiver\" before arriving at Hogsnorts._\n:::\n.........................................\n\nYou feel your blood prickle to the surface of your skin. Can this be real? Do you really have hidden powerful magic abilities? Maybe this is some big mistake? Or worse - a joke.\n\nBut then... there have been times where _strange things_ have occurred without you knowing why.\n\nLike that time you fell out of the apple tree in your cousin's house, but instead of falling down you _floated_ down like a leaf, and gently landed on the ground.\n\nOr that time you played hide and seek and wished that you could make yourself invisible and _no-one could find you_ even though you were just hiding under the kitchen table and it should have been easy.\n\nAnd the fact that every now and again you have a conversation with a spider and you can _understand what they are saying_.\n\nA slow smile spreads across your face. It _must be true!_\n\nYou are going to magic school.","choice_1_link":["recTWKbrULFSGNGhT"],"choice_1_text":"Go and buy your wizarding things","title":"The invitation","section":"section1","emoji":"üìú","interface_link":"https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/pagP1bZI9Mlm1p0Vk?khoME=recJIxxxJ4s3YbJ1b","interface_link_choice_1":["https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/pagP1bZI9Mlm1p0Vk?khoME=recTWKbrULFSGNGhT"],"choice_1_btn":{"label":"option 1","url":"https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/pagP1bZI9Mlm1p0Vk?khoME=recTWKbrULFSGNGhT"},"choice_2_btn":{"label":"option 2","url":""},"choice_3_btn":{"label":"option 3","url":""},"choice_4_btn":{"label":"option 4","url":""},"cluster":"letter","hyperlink_formula":"letter","hyperlink_final":"open-letter","choice_5_btn":{"label":"option 5","url":""},"autonumber":5,"chrono_num":5,"story_numbers":["recKxAeHcGrTcf83T"],"choice_1_storynum":[40],"choice_1_goto":"Go to number 40","story_num":[9],"record_link":"https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/tblY5DZkA8Y5UlgXt/viwInIHzWhN93PDbS/recJIxxxJ4s3YbJ1b"},{"id":"rechlQC8kI1ezjynZ","content":"It will be good to get to know someone you might be going to school with, perhaps he can tell you what it's like.\n\n\"Hello\" you say to the boy. \"I'm Arthur.

Now that you have your spellbook you want to get your hands on a wand as soon as possible and start doing some magic.\n\nThe sign above Wally's shop is a giant wand dangling from a chain above the shop door. It swings gently to and fro even though there is no breeze to speak of, and little crackles of electric-gold magic arc over its surface.\n\nYou can't help thinking that this wand must also double up as Wally's security system.\n\nWith a nervous glance upwards you and your Mum enter the shop.\n\nThe inside is sparklingly clean and glass cabinets are artfully arranged around the shop. Each cabinet contains three or four magic wands, resting on little red cushions with gold tassles. It all looks _very_ expensive.\n\n\"Arthur are you sure this is the only wand shop?\" asks your mum. \"Perhaps there is another one that is not quite so err... so un...\"\n\n\"Welcome!\" a smooth rich voice startles them from the back of the room. \"Welcome to Wally's Wanderful Wand shop! And madam I can assure you that this is the only wand shop in Hippoto Mews. But fear not I'm sure we can find a wand that is the perfect match for young Arthur.\"\n\n\"How did you know my name?\" you ask in surprise.\n\n\"One of the many branches of magic in which I am an expert, young Arthur, is mind reading. Just by looking into your eyes I can see the entire contents of your brain. I can also do it by looking in your ears, in your mouth, up your nose... any hole works to tell the truth. But I usually prefer the eyes. Also your Mum called you Arthur when you entered my shop.\"\n\n\"And you are Wally I suppose?\" says your Mum.\n\n\"I am indeed, dear madam. Did you divine this from looking in my ear hole? Remarkable!\"\n\n\"No I figured it out when you said this was your shop.\"\n\n\"Quite so. We are all mind-readers to some degree.\"\n\n\"Mr Wally\" you interrupt \"can I have a wand please?\"\n\n\"No you cannot have _a_ wand Arthur. But what you can have is _the_ wand. Every wand is unique! You are unique! You require the exact match for your particular thaumaturgical resonance. Your thaumaturgic twin as it were. The most powerful - the only! - tool you will ever need as a magician.\"\n\n\"That sounds nice,\" says your Mum, \"but we don't want anything _too_ fancy. The thing is we don't have much, or in fact any, wizard money. Frigates I mean.\"\n\n\"The wand is of course priceless. I do offer a 10% discount for Hogsnorts' students in their first year. But for you I will increase this discount to 100% if - if! - Arthur and I can establish a true connection of minds, and I can see that you Arthur are a worthy wandholder.\"\n\n\"A 100% discount you say? That's a good deal. Arthur see if you can connect up your mind with Wally's love.\" your Mum suggests.\n\nWally crouches down in front of you and holds your ears gently but firmly forcing you to look deep into his blue grey eyes. At first nothing happens. But after just a few moments you get the strange sensation of being _pulled_  towards his eyeballs; his black pupils feel like they are _dragging_ you inwards.\n\n\"Good Arthur, very good!\" says Wally. \"I believe that the magical connection between our minds is now established, and astonishingly quickly too! You must have deep reserves of magic.\n\n\"Arthur I need you to think of a number. If I can read your mind and tell you the number you were thinking of this will be proof that the magical mind connection is working properly.\n\n\"First I need you to think of a number between 1 and 10. But don't tell me what it is! Have you got one?\"\n\nYou think of a number and nod your head.\n\n\"Now\" says Wally, \"I need you to multiply this number by 9. 9 is a number with strong magical properties\" he explains.\n\nYou multiply your number by 9.\n\n\"The next step\" he says, \"is to split your answer into the two digits and add those two digits together. For example if your answer is 13 (and I know it is not!) then you would split it into 1 and 3, then add that 1 and 3 together, so 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n\"Ok\" you say as you do the sum in your head.\n\n\"Now take that answer and multiply it by 9. Can you do that?\"\n\n\"Yes\" you reply.\n\n\"Now turn to that number!

Soon you will get your hands on a wand and start doing some magic. Oh yeah.\n\nThe sign above Wally's shop is a giant wand dangling from a chain above the shop door. It swings gently to and fro even though there is no breeze to speak of, and little crackles of electric-gold magic arc over its surface.\n\nWith a nervous glance upwards you and your Mum enter the shop.\n\nThe inside is sparklingly clean and glass cabinets are artfully arranged around the shop. Each cabinet contains three or four magic wands, resting on little red cushions with gold tassles. It all looks _very_ expensive.\n\n\"Arthur are you sure this is the only wand shop?\" asks your mum. \"Perhaps there is another one that is not quite so err... so un...\"\n\n\"Welcome!\" a smooth rich voice startles them from the back of the room. \"Welcome to Wally's Wanderful Wand shop! And madam I can assure you that this is the only wand shop in Hippoto Mews. But fear not I'm sure we can find a wand that is the perfect match for young Arthur.\"\n\n\"How did you know my name?\" you ask in surprise.\n\n\"One of the many branches of magic in which I am an expert, young Arthur, is mind reading. Just by looking into your eyes I can see the entire contents of your brain. I can also do it by looking in your ears, in your mouth, up your nose... any hole works to tell the truth. But I usually prefer the eyes. Also your Mum called you Arthur when you entered my shop.\"\n\n\"And you are Wally I suppose?\" says your Mum.\n\n\"I am indeed, dear madam. Did you divine this from looking in my ear hole? Remarkable!\"\n\n\"No I figured it out when you said this was your shop.\"\n\n\"Quite so. We are all mind-readers to some degree.\"\n\n\"Mr Wally\" you interrupt \"can I have a wand please?\"\n\n\"No you cannot have _a_ wand Arthur. But what you can have is _the_ wand. Every wand is unique! You are unique! You require the exact match for your particular thaumaturgical resonance. Your thaumaturgic twin as it were. The most powerful - the only! - tool you will ever need as a magician.\"\n\n\"That sounds nice,\" says your Mum, \"but we don't want anything _too_ fancy. Or expensive.\"\n\n\"The wand is of course priceless. But you can buy one for 100 Golden Frigates.\"\n\n\"Golden what now?\" asks your Mum. \"Don't you take pounds? I don't have any Golden Frigates.\"\n\n\"It's wizard money only in this shop I'm afraid. I do offer a 10% discount for Hogsnorts' students in their first year... But for you I will increase this discount to 100% if - if! - Arthur and I can establish a true connection of minds, and I can see that you Arthur are a worthy wandholder.\"\n\n\"A 100% discount you say? That's a good deal. Arthur see if you can connect up your mind with Wally's love.\" your Mum suggests.\n\nWally crouches down in front of you and holds your ears gently but firmly forcing you to look deep into his blue grey eyes. At first nothing happens. But after just a few moments you get the strange sensation of being _pulled_  towards his eyeballs; his black pupils feel like they are _dragging_ you inwards.\n\n\"Good Arthur, very good!\" says Wally. \"I believe that the magical connection between our minds is now established, and astonishingly quickly too! You must have deep reserves of magic.\n\n\"Arthur I need you to think of a number. If I can read your mind and tell you the number you were thinking of this will be proof that the magical mind connection is working properly.\n\n\"First I need you to think of a number between 1 and 10. But don't tell me what it is! Have you got one?\"\n\nYou think of a number and nod your head.\n\n\"Now\" says Wally, \"I need you to multiply this number by 9. 9 is a number with strong magical properties\" he explains.\n\nYou multiply your number by 9.\n\n\"The next step\" he says, \"is to split your answer into the two digits and add those two digits together. For example if your answer is 13 (and I know it is not!) then you would split it into 1 and 3, then add that 1 and 3 together, so 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n\"Ok\" you say as you do the sum in your head.\n\n\"Now take that answer and multiply it by 7. Can you do that?\"\n\n\"Yes\" you reply.\n\n\"Now turn to that number!

Our Care of Magical Creatures Professor Mr Knid is leading the eradication efforts - \" Slumblebore pauses to acknowledge a flamboyantly caped teacher sitting next to him \" - although so far the little pests have proved stubbornly resistant. So I would ask all students that if they come across a spider in a corridor or in the classroom, please tread on it.\"\n\nYou notice Professor Knid grimace, no doubt embarrassed about his failure to control the infestation.\n\n\"Fifthly, on _no account_ are any children to enter the dungeon this term. We have picked up indications of some _extremely_ malevolent magic taking place down there. I have cast an enchantment of locking on the door and we are going to leave whatever it is going on down there _well alone_, thank you!\"\n\nYou notice all the other children whispering to each other - what could be going on in that dungeon that makes even Slumblebore afraid?\n\n\"Lastly, despite what I said last year I'm afraid Hogsnorts still doesn't have an internet connection. As you know the magical aurora interferes with mobile phone signals, and I'm afraid Professor Adeptus has not yet been able to figure out the correct incantations to get the WiFi router working.\"\n\nAnother groan, this time from all of the students, followed by disappointed muttering.\n\n\"But now, on to the child sorting!\" Slumbedore raises his hands for silence. \"Open the hole!\"\n\nA student scurries forward and pulls a lever by the platform at the front of the hall. Just in front of Slumblebore a huge stone flagstone slides slowly to one side leaving an opening in the floor.\n\nCraning your neck, you can see nothing but darkness, and some wooden steps leading down inside.

So yes I am going to Hogsnorts.\"\n\n\"Who is Sylvester Snake?\"\n\n\"Sylvester Snake is only the founder of Snake House! The best house in the school. I'm going to be in Snake House.

You want to get your hands on a wand as soon as possible and start doing some magic.\n\nThe sign above Wally's shop is a giant wand dangling from a chain above the shop door. It swings gently to and fro even though there is no breeze to speak of, and little crackles of electric-gold magic arc over its surface.\n\nYou can't help thinking that this wand must also double up as Wally's security system.\n\nWith a nervous glance upwards you and your Mum enter the shop.\n\nThe inside is sparklingly clean and glass cabinets are artfully arranged around the shop. Each cabinet contains three or four magic wands, resting on little red cushions with gold tassles. It all looks _very_ expensive.\n\n\"Arthur are you sure this is the only wand shop?\" asks your mum. \"Perhaps there is another one that is not quite so err... so un...\"\n\n\"Welcome!\" a smooth rich voice startles them from the back of the room. \"Welcome to Wally's Wanderful Wand shop! And madam I can assure you that this is the only wand shop in Hippoto Mews. But fear not I'm sure we can find a wand that is the perfect match for young Arthur.\"\n\n\"How did you know my name?\" you ask in surprise.\n\n\"One of the many branches of magic in which I am an expert, young Arthur is mind reading. Just by looking into your eyes I can see the entire contents of your brain. I can also do it by looking in your ears, in your mouth, up your nose... any hole works to tell the truth. But I usually prefer the eyes. Also your Mum called you Arthur when you entered my shop.\"\n\n\"And you are Wally I suppose?\" says your Mum.\n\n\"I am indeed, dear madam. Did you divine this from looking in my ear hole? Remarkable!\"\n\n\"No I figured it out when you said this was your shop.\"\n\n\"Quite so. We are all mind-readers to some degree.\"\n\n\"Mr Wally\" you interrupt \"can I have a wand please?\"\n\n\"No you cannot have _a_ wand Arthur. But what you can have is _the_ wand. Every wand is unique! You are unique! You require the exact match for your particular thaumaturgical resonance. Your thaumaturgic twin as it were. The most powerful - the only! - tool you will ever need as a magician.\"\n\n\"That sounds nice,\" says your Mum, \"but we don't want anything _too_ fancy. Or expensive.\"\n\n\"The wand is of course priceless. But you can buy one for 100 Golden Frigates.\"\n\n\"Golden what now?\" asks your Mum. \"Don't you take pounds? I don't have any Golden Frigates.\"\n\n\"It's wizard money only in this shop I'm afraid. I do offer a 10% discount for Hogsnorts' students in their first year... But for you I will increase this discount to 100% if - if! - Arthur and I can establish a true connection of minds, and I can see that you Arthur are a worthy wandholder.\"\n\n\"A 100% discount you say? That's a good deal. Arthur see if you can connect up your mind with Wally's love.\" your Mum suggests.\n\nWally crouches down in front of you and holds your ears gently but firmly forcing you to look deep into his blue grey eyes. At first nothing happens. But after just a few moments you get the strange sensation of being _pulled_  towards his eyeballs; his black pupils feel like they are _dragging_ you inwards.\n\n\"Good Arthur, very good!\" says Wally. \"I believe that the magical connection between our minds is now established, and astonishingly quickly too! You must have deep reserves of magic.\n\n\"Arthur I need you to think of a number. If I can read your mind and tell you the number you were thinking of this will be proof that the magical mind connection is working properly.\n\n\"First I need you to think of a number between 1 and 10. But don't tell me what it is! Have you got one?\"\n\nYou think of a number and nod your head.\n\n\"Now\" says Wally, \"I need you to multiply this number by 9. 9 is a number with strong magical properties\" he explains.\n\nYou multiply your number by 9.\n\n\"The next step\" he says, \"is to split your answer into the two digits and add those two digits together. For example if your answer is 13 (and I know it is not!) then you would split it into 1 and 3, then add that 1 and 3 together, so 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n\"Ok\" you say as you do the sum in your head.\n\n\"Now take that answer and multiply it by 8. Can you do that?\"\n\n\"Yes\" you reply.\n\n\"Now turn to that number!

I can see by your question that you are already on the path to enlightenment. Because it is only when we realise that we _don't_ know everything that we can learn.\"\n\nMadame Blavatsky smiles at you. \"And because you are ready to learn I will now teach you your first spell.\"\n\n\"But first can anyone tell me,\" she says addressing the whole class now, \"what is the most common cause of death for wizards and witches? Anyone?\"\n\n\"Fighting dragons?\" suggests Snako.\n\n\"Zombies?\" proposes another child.\n\n\"Soul suckers? Werewolves? Vampires?\"\n\n\"No, no and no again.\" replies Professor Blavatsky. \"The one thing that is most likely to kill you more than anything else is: each other.\"\n\n\"Let me explain. Imagine it is night time, 3am in the morning. You hear a noise downstairs. Immediately you are on the alert. It could be burglars. Or more likely dark wizards on the attack. You creep downstairs, wand at the ready. You can hear them rummaging around in the kitchen. You leap out shouting the most deadly spells you can think of. Only to discover... it is your Uncle Brian who is visiting for the weekend and has come down in the night to help himself to a biscuit. Now he is paralysed on the kitchen floor, a look of horror on his face and the packet of biscuits grasped so tightly in his hand that no-one else will be eating them ever again.\"\n\n\"Yes I'm afraid to say that the most common cause of death is 'friendly fire', accidentally hitting your friends and family with dangerous or deadly spells. The sad fact is that you are all in far more danger from each other than from any evil sorcerer. Which is why the spell I am going to teach you to protect against dark magic is a sleeping spell. It is one I designed myself. The benefit of this spell is that it is completely reversible. To wake someone up, you just need to tickle them under their armpits.\"\n\nBlavatsky then whips out her wand and points it at Snako.\n\n\"Somnolencia salchicha sabrosa!\" she screams.\n\nA dart of pure golden light shoots out of the end of her wand and hits Snako right in the middle of his forehead. In less than a half a second his head has sunk down to his arms on his desk and he is snoring like a sailor.\n\nThe class breaks out into a round of applause.\n\n\"Make sure you get the pronunciation just right when you cast the spell\" Blavataksy advises as she walks over to Snako and tickles him under the armpits.\n\n\"He he he! What happened?\" says Snako, confused.\n\nThe class splits into pairs and you practice sending each other to sleep. Because Snako is still a bit drowsy you go first, pointing your wand at his forehead just as the teacher did:\n\n\"Somnolencia salchicha sabrosa...\" you repeat carefully.\n\nYou feel a wonderful feeling of magical power gathering in your tummy. In an instant it has whooshed up out of your arm, channelled by the wand into a golden dart that zaps Snako on the head, for the second time in as many minutes.\n\nIn no time at all he is asleep and snoring again.\n\n\"I did it!\" you shout. \"The magic spell worked!\"\n\nDelighted with your success you tickle Snako under the armpits. As he wakes up giggling you try hard to memorise the spell 'Somnolencia salchicha sabrosa' - you never know when it may come in handy.","choice_1_link":["recZQNIrYJFJ1Rxos"],"status":"Done","choice_1_text":"Murmuring the words of the spell to yourself, you go back to the school hall.","title":"Spelling trouble","section":"section2-snake","emoji":"üç™","interface_link":"https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/pagP1bZI9Mlm1p0Vk?khoME=recf0NWSOGlT49tUm","interface_link_choice_1":["https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/pagP1bZI9Mlm1p0Vk?khoME=recZQNIrYJFJ1Rxos"],"choice_1_btn":{"label":"option 1","url":"https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/pagP1bZI9Mlm1p0Vk?khoME=recZQNIrYJFJ1Rxos"},"choice_2_btn":{"label":"option 2","url":""},"choice_3_btn":{"label":"option 3","url":""},"choice_4_btn":{"label":"option 4","url":""},"cluster":"school","place":"snakefang","hyperlink_formula":"school-snakefang-3-spells-blavat","hyperlink_final":"school-lionpaw-3-spells-blavat-s","sequence":"3","choice_5_btn":{"label":"option 5","url":""},"link_text":"spells-blavat","autonumber":232,"chrono_num":86,"story_numbers":["recLX9nSNw8IVrm8M"],"choice_1_storynum":[133],"choice_1_goto":"Go to number 133","story_num":[71],"record_link":"https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/tblY5DZkA8Y5UlgXt/viwInIHzWhN93PDbS/recf0NWSOGlT49tUm"},{"id":"recVldZcc4YCOISLW","content":"\"Yes! 72 is the number - fantastic!\" says Wally, beaming with delight.\n\n\"Our minds have a strong magical connection and I can see that you are truly a worthy wandholder, and deserving of my special 100% discount.

Standing next to Kensley Potato you smile shyly at her - it is funny to think that you will be friends for the next 6 years, or maybe for life.\n\n\"Hoggers, follow me!\" calls out an older girl from the front of the line, and you all file after her obediently.\n\nThe girl leads you for what seems like ages, along long winding stone passageways that at times are so smooth that they must have been built by magic, at other times so rough and uneven that you keep tripping. They pass by soaring windows with beautiful stained glass scenes showing witches on broomsticks and unicorns jumping over rainbows. They run low underground in damp dark tunnels that are lit only by the occasional flickering torch.\n\nAt last just as your feet were starting to drag with tiredness, the girl leading the way stops abruptly.\n\n\"Well done everyone,\" she says. \"We've arrived. Welcome to Hedgehog House tower.\"\n\nYou realise that you have stopped just before a stone archway painted in the Hedgehog House colours of brown. The stone arch itself is carved into the shape of a hedgehog stretched over the path.\n\n\"Now Hoggers,\" continues the girl. \"Remember that it is only Hedgehog House students - Hoggers - who can enter this tower. So if you have friends in other houses...\" the children around you make tutting and pshaw sounds \"...you will have to meet them somewhere else!\n\n\"First years we still have a bit more walking to do but you will be able to rest soon so keep going.\"\n\nWith that she turns and strides through the archway. You, Kensley, and all the other children follow her. Beyond the archway is a winding stone staircase that spirals slowly upwards. After 500 steps you lose count and you just plod on, eyes only on the step in front.\n\nJust at the point when you were beginning to wonder if there is any more tower left to climb you bump into Kensley who has come to a sudden halt in front of you. The whole line of children has stopped and you can hear them whisper to each other: \"There's a door at the top, the girl is opening the door...\".\n\nYou can't see the door yet because it is around another turn of the spiral staircase but you hear a creaking sound as it opens. Unexpectedly, a fresh earthy smell wafts down the staircase.\n\nThe children shuffle upwards.\n\nWhen you reach the doorway you stop and stare. You can't believe what you are seeing. Rather than the top of a tower as you expected the stairs have led to a short tunnel that emerges from... the side of a hill. In the distance you can see - impossibly - Hogsnorts School. Somehow Hognsorts School is both just behind you in the passageway and at the same time it is far away across the broken countryside.\n\nBy some powerful magic the Hedgehog House staircase has taken you a mile _away_ from the school and then deep underground.\n\nYou look around the grassy hillside that you have emerged onto and see a series of smooth stony paths branching out all over the hill. The paths lead past circular doors set into the hill. Over each circular door is a small sign.\n\nYou read the one closest to you: \"Brian Banana\" it says.\n\n\"Ah there we go!\" You hear a voice behind you and someone shoulders past, walks to the door and goes inside.\n\n\"See you later Brian!\" someone shouts out.\n\nSo that must be... Brian Banana, you think. And that door leads to his own little hole... and if _he_ has a hole... everyone must have a hole, including me!\n\n\"Kensley,\" you cry out, full of energy again. \"Let's find our holes!\"\n\nYou both run off huffing down the path and before long you see a round door, painted green, with your name written on a sign above it: \"Arthur Otley\". Next to it is another door with \"Kensley Potato\" spelled out above.\n\nYou push on the shiny yellow brass knob in the centre of the green door and it swings open.\n\nYou are confronted by the most comfortable little living hole you could imagine: lined with wood, and carpeted, there are polished chairs and pegs for coats. The tunnel (because it was a tunnel really, not a hole as you had first thought) winds on into the side of the hill, with rooms leading off it left and right: bedrooms, bathrooms, cellars, pantries, wardrobes, all well stocked. In the rooms to the left of the tunnel deep-set round windows look out onto the hillside and meadows beyond, with Hogsnorts School far away.\n\nAfter passing a dozen rooms, including one that seems dedicated to gaming with four different types of games console in it, plus a virtual reality headset, you arrive at your own bedroom, warm and comfortable. You lie down on the soft welcoming bed that occupies half the room. While you eat the mint chocolate that you found on the pillow, and cuddle the soft hedgehog toy, also left for you on the bed, you find yourself smiling.\n\nIn this little Hogger-hole safe underground you feel relaxed and secure.

The Hoggers of Hedgehog House joined you when the Ravenclaws gave in.\n\nIt was only the Lionpaws who didn't join you but by then you already had enough students to put the second part of your plan into action.\n\nYou split the students into groups of four. Each quartet was assigned a small insect army to help them. Using teleportation magic each group went to a different country and sneaked into the president's house.\n\nAt exactly the same minute of the same hour of the same day your magical minions appeared before the presidents of every country in the world, whether they were in their office, asleep in the bedrooms or having a bath.\n\nYou personally assigned yourself the President of the United States, Snako at your side.\n\n\"What the...?

I am here to inform you that a new world order has begun! The Order of the Arthropods! From now on you take orders only from me.\"\n\nThe President didn't like it - of course he didn't - but you menace him with the termites and he sees he has no choice.\n\nPutting an enchanted earwig behind his ear, you explain to the president that whenever you have orders for him you will communicate through the earwig who will whisper into his ear hole. \n\n\"You'd better do whatever he says Mr President\" adds Snako, \"Otherwise we'll set the termites on you.\"\n\nAnd then you vanish, leaving behind a puff of smoke and a million twenties who crawl into cracks in the floor and walls, ready to spring out if called.\n\nThe next morning the world wakes up to some startling news. All the presidents of every country in the world have simultaneously announced three new laws for everyone: \n\n- All the children of the world are allowed to play video games for as long as they like every day (even if it is bedtime).\n- Ice cream (at least three flavours) will be made available at every meal, as a starter.\n- Harming insects is a crime.\n\nYou smile happily as you listen to the news on the television while licking your breakfast ice cream. \n\nYou wonder what your next instructions will be...\n\nCONGRATULATIONS - YOU HAVE ACHIEVED THE WORLD DOMINATION ENDING!","status":"Done","title":"Epilogue","section":"section2-snake","emoji":"ü™µ","interface_link":"https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/pagP1bZI9Mlm1p0Vk?khoME=recxFaMCWpjAUccmR","choice_1_btn":{"label":"option 1","url":""},"choice_2_btn":{"label":"option 2","url":""},"choice_3_btn":{"label":"option 3","url":""},"choice_4_btn":{"label":"option 4","url":""},"hyperlink_final":"choose-power-epilogue-s","choice_5_btn":{"label":"option 5","url":""},"autonumber":251,"chrono_num":124,"story_numbers":["reco4lOldkvp2RkIx"],"choice_1_goto":"Go to number ","story_num":[103],"record_link":"https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/tblY5DZkA8Y5UlgXt/viwInIHzWhN93PDbS/recxFaMCWpjAUccmR"},{"id":"rec0NoiOc90ZNyp0E","hyperlink":"fishy-spell","content":"Surveying the hordes of woodlice in front of you, you raise your wand up high and cry out in a loud voice: \n\n\"Amansa at√∫n!\"\n\nFor a moment nothing happens.\n\nThen three glimmering golden bubbles expand into the air in front of you, until they are the size of footballs.

No boy, snakes are _not_ better than insects.\n\n\"Firstly: snakes can't fly but insects can. Insects have been flying for over 350 million years! And to think we are always _so impressed_ by the birds. Look at me, look at my feathers, I'm a bird! But insects have been flying for twice as long as birds - birds only evolved 150 million years ago. Pathetic.\n\n\"Secondly: a snake's cleverness is nothing compared even to an ant, who - working together - can build homes hundreds of times taller than they are. Skyscrapers! With air-conditioning, nurseries, storage chambers. And what is a snake's home? Just a pile of old logs. Pathetic. \n\n\"Thirdly: how many snakes are there in the world? Not many I can tell you. Or how many reptiles even? All the snakes, iguanas, and lizards put together?\n\nReptiles make up only 0.1% of all animal species.\n\nInsects species make up 70% of all animal species, and if we include all arthropods that's over 80%. That means for every one reptile species (like a snake) there are _more than 600 insect species_.\n\n\"No, it is clear to me, as it should now be clear to you, that snakes are pitiful, almost inconsequential creatures compared to insects and arthropods.\"\n\n\"But sir,\" interrupts Snako, \"insects _are_ disgusting...\"\n\n\"Oh the cheek of it!

But the perspective of the students sitting in the hall is as if they are a tiny creature in the undergrowth - blades of grass tower above them, giant ants scurry past and occasionally birds that appear to be the size of aeroplanes swoop overhead. \n\nYou stare wide eyed as a stag beetle lumbers past you, each footstep making the ground vibrate. It is a fantastic, incredible scene, and a bit scary \n\n\"Don't forget to eat Arthur!\" Kensley reminds you with a smile.\n\nYou look down to see yet another incredible feast. \n\nIn keeping with the enchanted hall, where the ceiling and walls show everything huge, normal food has been enchanted to an enormous size. Garden peas the size of tennis balls are piled on a plate. Sausages the size of small boats lie lengthways on the table swimming in gravy. Roast potatoes bigger than your head sit in a dish that would be considered big if it was a bathtub.\n\nIt is all so delicious you can't stop an involuntary dribble which you quickly wipe from your chin with the table cloth.\n\nYou cram food into your mouth and gulp it down.\n\nIn a bizarre magical twist, as soon as the food is in your tummy it returns to its normal size, so you have to eat vast quantities of the enchanted sausage and veg to fill yourself up. This suits you and Kensley just fine - eating is one of your favourite things!\n\nWhen you are finally reaching the end of the meal the enchanted scene suddenly transforms into a terrific battle as a stream of army ants overruns the jungle undergrowth attacking everything in their path with their fearsome mandibles. The Great Hall appears to be _picked up_ and _carried along_ by these implacable insects, and enchanted chairs tilt crazily as you ride along on the back of the army ant horde.\n\nIt is looking grim for the students and several Hedgehog House students, including Kensley, vomit on the floor, overcome with fright and motion sickness.\n\nBut just at the point the ants are taking the Great Hall down into their underground lair, in this intricate magical simulation, a small herd of ant-eaters charge onto the scene. Their long flexible tongues lash out from side to side, slurping up ants by the thousand and soon the army ant horde is no more, leaving the Great Hall in peace once more on the forest floor. \n\n\"Hooray for Hogsnorts, hooray for Slumblebore!\" you shout, delighted at the evening's entertainment, even if it was a bit scary. You lead the Hoggers in a chant of \"Hoggers up, Hoggers down, Hoggers hoggers stand your ground\" and everyone cheers in general merriment, ending the best dinner you have ever had.\n\nTurning to Kensley you say.","choice_1_link":["recAOTWUfxFXGfIuI"],"status":"Done","choice_2_link":["rec8LU3QD92tDCSea"],"choice_1_text":"I'm tired out, let's go back to the Tower and get some rest.","choice_2_text":"Why don't we explore the castle?

Good.\" says Professor Knid. \"Now we are all agreed, I can tell you that today we will be studying the marvellous woodlouse. Flies, deliver the woodlice!\"\n\nAt this command, a hundred or so flies detach themselves from Knid's cape, zoom over to a box on the professor's desk and pick up the woodlice, one between four flies. The flies then carry one woodlice to each student and drop it onto the desk in front of them. The flies buzz back to Professor Knid and reattach themselves to his cloak.\n\nThe little woodlouse on your desk appears disturbed at this unexpected flight. It takes one look at you then rolls up into a ball. \n\n\"Now can anyone move their woodlouse using a magic spell?\" asks Knid. \"Try any magic spell that you know.\" \n\nYou raise your wand, point it at the woodlouse and mumble \"abracadabra\" rather hopefully.\n\nYou are delighted to see a little sparkle of gold stars shoot out of the end of your wand. The sparkles hit the woodlouse... and bounce right off! The woodlouse is unmoved.\n\nLooking around the classroom you can see that the other children are having no more success than you did.\n\nAaron singed his own eyebrows when his lightning spell bounced off the woodlouse and hit him in the face. Kensley Potato's ice spell has frozen her desk into a solid block of ice but not touched the woodlouse. Brian Banana (another student from Hedgehog) has tried to make his woodlouse disappear but accidentally lost his wand in the process.\n\n\"The woodlouse, children, as you are discovering, is completely impervious to magic. So if you want to move the woodlouse you must first _understand_ the woodlouse. And the one thing that scares the woodlouse more than anything else is drying out. As soon as they lose their moisture they die. Now - look at this.\"\n\nProfessor Knid raises his wand in an impressively expansive gesture and recites: \"Fiel fresa fusila fuego!\"\n\nA large flame whooshes out of the end of his wand and starts to bake the air around the woodlouse on his desk. Terrified of being dried out, the woodlouse unrolls and scuttles away as fast as he can.\n\n\"So we can see that _indirect_ magic can be powerful against even magic resistant creatures. And we didn't have to harm any arthropods in the process. Now children it's your turn. Wands at the ready!\"\n\nYou look down at your cowering woodlouse and, aiming with your wand, recite the words of the spell: \n\n\"Fiel fresa fusila fuego!\"\n\nFrom the tips of your fingers to the ends of your toes you can feel a powerful magic charge building in your body. It concentrates in your chest and then zooms along your arm and out of your wand in a very impressive jet of flame. \n\nYou are overjoyed at the result, the first time you have cast such a powerful spell. Just think what you could do with such magic!\n\nThe woodlouse feels the magical flames heat the air and desk around him, and scarpers.\n\n\"I did it!\" you cry, and commit the words of the spell to your memory: fiel fresa fusila fuego.","choice_1_link":["recppqyKKHbhVd13r"],"choice_1_text":"Feeling delighted you head back to the hall to decide what to do next","title":"Knid's spell","section":"section2-lion","emoji":"üî•","interface_link":"https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/pagP1bZI9Mlm1p0Vk?khoME=rec8vi81TYhc1128e","interface_link_choice_1":["https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/pagP1bZI9Mlm1p0Vk?khoME=recppqyKKHbhVd13r"],"choice_1_btn":{"label":"option 1","url":"https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/pagP1bZI9Mlm1p0Vk?khoME=recppqyKKHbhVd13r"},"choice_2_btn":{"label":"option 2","url":""},"choice_3_btn":{"label":"option 3","url":""},"choice_4_btn":{"label":"option 4","url":""},"cluster":"school","place":"lesson","hyperlink_formula":"school-lesson-3-spells-knid","hyperlink_final":"school-lesson-3-spells-knid","sequence":"3","choice_5_btn":{"label":"option 5","url":""},"link_text":"spells-knid","autonumber":100,"chrono_num":83,"story_numbers":["recewDw64V3ascMB7"],"choice_1_storynum":[225],"choice_1_goto":"Go to number 225","story_num":[118],"record_link":"https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/tblY5DZkA8Y5UlgXt/viwInIHzWhN93PDbS/rec8vi81TYhc1128e"},{"id":"rec2Zc86tMaJnhhpg","content":"\"Let's take a look around, lessons can wait!\" you say to Daniel and the two of you walk down the wooden corridor (which is actually the hollow inside of just one great branch of this mighty tree) towards the trunk.\n\nYou enter the tree trunk about three stories up, and you can see Ravenwing students darting to and fro across the floor, heading off to their lessons. Some of them are whistling for parrots who fly off into the depths and retrieve arcane books, scrolls of ancient wisdom, and the occasional comic. \n\nSoon they have all gone allowing you and Daniel the chance to explore uninterrupted. \n\nThe first place you go to is a room labelled 'FRUIT CORNER\", just across the trunk from you. Fruit Corner turns out to be a large spherical room, with woody growths emerging from the walls and ceiling. At the end of each growth hangs a fruit that looks a bit like a giant strawberry and glows with a faint golden light.\n\nYou pick one from a branch and nibble the end tentatively. Immediately your eyes light up and you cram more into your mouth. \n\n\"It's...\" scrunch \"the best thing...\" scrunch \"I have ever tasted...\" scrunch \"in my whole life!\"\n\nIt's like eating the best fruit salad you can imagine but also as if a luscious cream has been mixed in plus dollops of honey. After eating just one of these magical fruits you find you are completely full - and not in a feeling-sick-sort-of-way but in a totally-satisfied-and-not-at-all-feeling-sick kind of way.\n\nThe rest of the day is spent climbing up the inside of the tree trunk and sliding at tremendous speeds down the spiral wooden slides that are naturally polished with amber.\n\nYou also find a door in the tree to go outside and chamber around the branches for a while. You encounter the magical giant squirrels that live in the canopy - once normal red squirrels, eating the nuts of the tree has given them the power of speech as well as growing them to the size of kangaroos. \n\nThey invite you to climb on their backs, and they race to the top of the tree with you and Daniel clinging onto their fur and shouting with delight.\n\nYou swim in the pools of streaming water far out in the branches, captured in natural dips of the wood, and heated by some magic of the tree itself.\n\nYou meet the ancient raven with only one eye who lives at the very top of the tree, the raven that was befriended by the founder of Ravenwing House, Rebecca Ravenwing, all those centuries ago. \n\nFinally you go back to the library inside the trunk of the tree and whistle for all the books you can think of.\n\nDaniel reads 'Travels through the multiverse' by Daniel Colliers-Wood, a mind-blowing book which he will write in 25 years time. Also 'The Crying Potato' by his brother Robin Colliers-Wood, due to be published in only five years.\n\nYou enjoy 'Adventures with Dragons' by Arthur Otley and also 'Mr Poopy Head' by your brother Evan Otley, which he will write when he is only seven.\n\nAs you eat just one more delicious fruit-salad-fruit from the fruit corner room, the other Ravewing students traipse back into the massive trunk.\n\n\"Arthur, Daniel,\" shouts one anonymous bit-part student. \"it's dinner time!\"","choice_1_link":["recJjn5YicXHmq5QU"],"choice_2_link":["recrysomwQf8bldIH"],"choice_1_text":"You are not that hungry... but you could manage another course or two of delicious food.","choice_2_text":"You are so stuffed full of fruit you decide to give it a miss and go straight to bed.","title":"Bunking off","section":"section2-raven","emoji":"ü©≥","interface_link":"https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/pagP1bZI9Mlm1p0Vk?khoME=rec2Zc86tMaJnhhpg","interface_link_choice_2":["https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/pagP1bZI9Mlm1p0Vk?khoME=recrysomwQf8bldIH"],"interface_link_choice_1":["https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/pagP1bZI9Mlm1p0Vk?khoME=recJjn5YicXHmq5QU"],"choice_1_btn":{"label":"option 1","url":"https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/pagP1bZI9Mlm1p0Vk?khoME=recJjn5YicXHmq5QU"},"choice_2_btn":{"label":"option 2","url":"https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/pagP1bZI9Mlm1p0Vk?khoME=recrysomwQf8bldIH"},"choice_3_btn":{"label":"option 3","url":""},"choice_4_btn":{"label":"option 4","url":""},"cluster":"school","place":"ravenwing","hyperlink_formula":"school-ravenwing-3-bunk-off","hyperlink_final":"school-ravenwing-3-bunk-off","sequence":"3","choice_5_btn":{"label":"option 5","url":""},"link_text":"bunk-off","autonumber":103,"choice_2_storynum":[239],"chrono_num":74,"story_numbers":["recEZ0sfugUKbHlaW"],"choice_1_storynum":[80],"choice_1_goto":"Go to number 80","choice_2_goto":"Go to number 239","story_num":[119],"record_link":"https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/tblY5DZkA8Y5UlgXt/viwInIHzWhN93PDbS/rec2Zc86tMaJnhhpg"},{"id":"recciG3v7vPyT8co6","hyperlink":"back-to-the-tower","content":"\"Let's go back to the House Tower,\" you say to Aaron. \"I'm tired out, it must be really late now.\"\n\nThe two of you trudge wearily back to the Lionpaw House Tower.

No way are you going to let Slumblebore down and the insects take over - you are going to save the school!\n\nYou were aiming your magical fire at Azog but he is too nimble and leaps out of the way.\n\n\"You will regret your choice Arthur,\" screams the spider king in outrage. \"Insects, attack!\"\n\nFrom out of cracks in the walls, ceiling and floor crawl millions upon millions of arthropods: beetles, woodlice, ants, millipedes, earwigs, spiders in a great stream heading straight for you.\n\nThis time you don't hesitate. You turn and flee. \n\nYour heart pounding, you run back out of the dungeon up towards the school. But you are not running out of cowardice. You have a plan.\n\nWhen you reach the enchanted door that leads down into the dungeon you dash through and slam it shut. You can hear the enchanted locking mechanism clicking shut.\n\nThere's only one way for the insects to get past the door now - through the keyhole. You turn and wait, your wand at the ready.\n\nAs soon as you see the first hairy little leg poking out of the keyhole you use your wand as a flamethrower shouting \"fiel fresa fusila fuego\" again and again until your voice is hoarse.\n\nThe air is full of the harsh high pitched cries of dying arthropods and the sizzle of roasting chitin. But still the insects come, propelled onwards by the Great Azog's iron will.\n\nYou are getting tired now, your arm is sore from being held up so long and you can feel your reserves of magical energy running out. You cannot hold out much longer.\n\nFor a moment the magical fire from your wand flickers and dies.\n\nThen three things happen simultaneously: \n\nOne: Azog, sensing his chance, launches himself through the keyhole aiming straight for your face. \n\nTwo: Aaron and Slumblebore run round the corner to see you standing alone against the numberless insect foe.\n\nThree: You draw your compass from your pocket, thinking that even as your magic fails you will be able to stab a few more of the blighters with the pointy end before you are overwhelmed.\n\nThen...\n\nAzog flies through the air, fangs at the ready, just as your arm holding the compass comes _up_. He impales himself on the point of the compass, which buries itself deep in the spider king's abdomen.\n\nThe last words of Azog the Great are \"Arthur... you have broken my heart...\". Then a trickle of blue blood seeps out of the wound and Azog is no more.\n\nWith Azog a gonner the rest of the arthropod hordes lose all cohesion. When Slumblebore cautiously opens the door to the dungeon they are fleeing in all directions, and will trouble the school no more. Slumblebore lets off a few more blasts of fire to encourage them on their way.\n\n\"You did it Arthur!\" cries Aaron. \"You saved the school - the evil has gone!\"\n\nYou stand still and listen carefully. Aaron is right. You cannot sense evilness any longer. The dungeons have been cleansed.\n\n\"Well done indeed Arthur,\" and Slumblebore, turning back to you. \"I had a feeling that you were the special one. Without you I fear we would have been overrun by insects by now.\"\n\n\"It was Eric Knid,\" you say to Slumblebore. \"It was Professor Knid who summoned the insect army, with Azog the spider king.

Looking into your eyes, he nods his head and climbs up onto your hand then up your arm and onto your shoulder.\n\n\"Athropods, prepare yourselves!\" shouts out Azog and out of the walls and ceiling untold millions of insects emerge, each one pitifully small but together forming a huge unstoppable army.\n\n\"Today we have a new leader! He is the chosen one whose coming to the dungeon was foretold. He stands here before you: Arthur Otley!\"\n\nMarvelling at the hordes of insects at your command you feel dizzy and excited.

You quickly appraise them of their situation: you have a vast insect army, they don't. \n\nOffering Aaron a position as second in command of the Order of the Arthropods, you are delighted when he agrees to join your side.\n\nYou offer Slumblebore to continue in his role as headmaster, but only if he acknowledges you as Supreme Governor, and accepts that the Order of the Arthropods will from now on win the House Cup every year forever. Otherwise you will instruct your insect hordes to take over by force.\n\nSlumblebore is reluctant, but he has no other option. If insects are seen running amok in the school it will be terrible publicity and the parents will withhold their school fees.\n\nThe next morning Slumblebore calls a general assembly of the school and announces the new order. The insect's army is hidden in cracks in the walls but ready to leap out if necessary. \n\n\"And so,\" Slumblebore concludes,\"Arthur Otley must now be obeyed by everyone. Furthermore, there is a new school rule: anyone caught stepping on a spider or squashing an ant will be imprisoned within the dungeon - for life.\"\n\nThere are shocked gasps around the room.

Imagine it is night time, 3am in the morning. You hear a noise downstairs. Immediately you are on the alert. It could be burglars. Or more likely dark wizards on the attack. You creep downstairs, wand at the ready. You can hear them rummaging around in the kitchen. You leap out shouting the most deadly spells you can think of. Only to discover... it is your Uncle Brian who is visiting for the weekend and has come down in the night to help himself to a biscuit. Now he is paralysed on the kitchen floor, a look of horror on his face and the packet of biscuits grasped so tightly in his hand that no-one else will be eating them ever again.\"\n\n\"Yes I'm afraid to say that the most common cause of death is 'friendly fire', or over-reacting to an imagined threat. The sad fact is that you are all in far more danger from each other than from any evil sorcerer. Which is why the spell I am going to teach you to protect against dark magic is a sleeping spell. It is one I designed myself. To wake someone up from this spell you just need to tickle them under their armpits.\"\n\nBlavatsky then whips out her wand and points it at Aaron.\n\n\"Somnolencia salchicha sabrosa!\" she yells out.\n\nA dart of pure golden light shoots out of the end of her wand and hits Aaron right in the middle of his forehead. In less than a half a second his head has sunk down to his arms on his desk and he is snoring like a sailor.\n\nThe class breaks out into a round of applause.\n\n\"Make sure you get the pronunciation just right when you cast the spell\" Blavataksy advises as she walks over to Aaron and tickles him under the armpits.\n\n\"He he he!

Because Aaron is still a bit drowsy you go first, pointing your wand at his forehead just as the teacher did:\n\n\"Somnolencia salchicha sabrosa...\" you repeat carefully.\n\nYou feel a wonderful feeling of magical power gathering in your tummy. In an instant it has whooshed up out of your arm, channelled by the wand into a golden dart that zaps Aaron on the head, for the second time in as many minutes.\n\nIn no time at all he is asleep and snoring again.\n\n\"I did it!\" you shout. \"The magic spell worked!\"\n\nDelighted with your success you tickle Aaron under the armpits. As he wakes up giggling you try hard to memorise the spell 'Somnolencia salchicha sabrosa' - you never know when it may come in handy.","choice_1_link":["recppqyKKHbhVd13r"],"choice_1_text":"Murmuring the words of the spell to yourself, you go back to the school hall.","title":"Spelling trouble","section":"section2-lion","emoji":"üç™","interface_link":"https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/pagP1bZI9Mlm1p0Vk?khoME=recd8A2TCrTYfxRL8","interface_link_choice_1":["https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/pagP1bZI9Mlm1p0Vk?khoME=recppqyKKHbhVd13r"],"choice_1_btn":{"label":"option 1","url":"https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/pagP1bZI9Mlm1p0Vk?khoME=recppqyKKHbhVd13r"},"choice_2_btn":{"label":"option 2","url":""},"choice_3_btn":{"label":"option 3","url":""},"choice_4_btn":{"label":"option 4","url":""},"cluster":"school","place":"lionpaw","hyperlink_formula":"school-lionpaw-3-spells-blavat","hyperlink_final":"school-lionpaw-3-spells-blavat","sequence":"3","choice_5_btn":{"label":"option 5","url":""},"link_text":"spells-blavat","autonumber":119,"chrono_num":86,"story_numbers":["recldJ0iGF0LeT3Ue"],"choice_1_storynum":[225],"choice_1_goto":"Go to number 225","story_num":[129],"record_link":"https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/tblY5DZkA8Y5UlgXt/viwInIHzWhN93PDbS/recd8A2TCrTYfxRL8"},{"id":"recFr7VhYPIRIIXwe","hyperlink":"door-zaggedy-r","content":"\"Ziggidy zaggady zock unlock!\" you cry, flourishing your wand.\n\nThe door starts to shine with a magical golden glow.\n\n\"That's amazing,\" you think to yourself, \"I think it's going to work!\"","choice_1_link":["recTQrMFucFgyiusf"],"status":"Done","choice_1_text":"I think you managed to guess the password!

Or possibly it was Barry.\n\n\"Ever since then he has lived with me. We get along famously although I must admit that his table manners are not all that they might be - he has an unfortunate habit of defecating in the raisins.\"\n\nWesley hangs his head, shamefacedly. \n\n\"But do not let that worry you,\" says Slumblebore brightening. \"Because every once in a while, I cast a spell to turn all the droppings in the room into raisins.

Imagine it is night time, 3am in the morning. You hear a noise downstairs. Immediately you are on the alert. It could be burglars. Or more likely dark wizards on the attack. You creep downstairs, wand at the ready. You can hear them rummaging around in the kitchen. You leap out shouting the most deadly spells you can think of. Only to discover... it is your Uncle Brian who is visiting for the weekend and has come down in the night to help himself to a biscuit. Now he is paralysed on the kitchen floor, a look of horror on his face and the packet of biscuits grasped so tightly in his hand that no-one else will be eating them ever again.\"\n\n\"Yes I'm afraid to say that the most common cause of death is 'friendly fire', accidentally hitting your friends and family with dangerous or deadly spells. The sad fact is that you are all in far more danger from each other than from any evil sorcerer. Which is why the spell I am going to teach you to protect against dark magic is a sleeping spell. It is one I designed myself. The benefit of this spell is that it is completely reversible. To wake someone up, you just need to tickle them under their armpits.\"\n\nBlavatsky then whips out her wand and points it at Daniel.\n\n\"Somnolencia salchicha sabrosa!\" she screams.\n\nA dart of pure golden light shoots out of the end of her wand and hits Daniel right in the middle of his forehead. In less than a half a second his head has sunk down to his arms on his desk and he is snoring peacefully.\n\nThe class breaks out into a round of applause.\n\n\"Make sure you get the pronunciation just right when you cast the spell\" Blavataksy advises as she walks over to Daniel and tickles him under the armpits.\n\n\"He he he! What happened?\" says Daniel, confused.\n\nThe class splits into pairs and you practice sending each other to sleep. Because Daniel is still a bit drowsy you go first, pointing your wand at his forehead just as the teacher did:\n\n\"Somnolencia salchicha sabrosa...\" you repeat carefully.\n\nYou feel a wonderful feeling of magical _alertness_ gathering in your tummy. In an instant it has whooshed up out of your arm, channelled by the wand into a golden dart that strikes Daniel on the forehead, for the second time in as many minutes.\n\nIn no time at all he is asleep and snoring again.\n\n\"I did it!\" you shout. \"The magic spell worked!\"\n\nDelighted with your success you tickle Daniel under the armpits. As he wakes up giggling you try hard to memorise the spell 'Somnolencia salchicha sabrosa' - you never know when it may come in handy.","choice_1_link":["recUhW3XjJO2NoN4W"],"status":"Done","choice_1_text":"Murmuring the words of the spell to yourself, you go back to the school hall.","title":"Spelling trouble","section":"section2-raven","emoji":"üç™","interface_link":"https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/pagP1bZI9Mlm1p0Vk?khoME=recc82U63rWXyAVli","interface_link_choice_1":["https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/pagP1bZI9Mlm1p0Vk?khoME=recUhW3XjJO2NoN4W"],"choice_1_btn":{"label":"option 1","url":"https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/pagP1bZI9Mlm1p0Vk?khoME=recUhW3XjJO2NoN4W"},"choice_2_btn":{"label":"option 2","url":""},"choice_3_btn":{"label":"option 3","url":""},"choice_4_btn":{"label":"option 4","url":""},"cluster":"school","place":"ravenwing","hyperlink_formula":"school-ravenwing-3-spells-blavat","hyperlink_final":"school-lionpaw-3-spells-blavat-r","sequence":"3","choice_5_btn":{"label":"option 5","url":""},"link_text":"spells-blavat","autonumber":334,"chrono_num":86,"story_numbers":["recxmkt74UtIR2Kny"],"choice_1_storynum":[117],"choice_1_goto":"Go to number 117","story_num":[143],"record_link":"https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/tblY5DZkA8Y5UlgXt/viwInIHzWhN93PDbS/recc82U63rWXyAVli"},{"id":"recMksxgpgiUknJ3p","hyperlink":"choose-power-epilogue-r","content":"The first kid to step forward is a boy named Snako Malboy from Snakefang house.

But it is only to extract a harmless DNA sample from the boy's blood, and when the other children realise this more and more of them approach in the hopes that they too will be made superhuman.\n\nThen the hard work begins. \n\nWith Azog, Daniel Colliers Wood and some of the more intelligent Ravenwing students you lock yourselves into a magical laboratory with the childrens' DNA samples. Collecting additional DNA from your insect army it is not long before you have created a powerful hybrid human-insect DNA serum, which you further refine into substrains for isolated traits: wings, antenna, hairy legs and so on.\n\nBy the time of school assembly on the following day you are ready. \n\n\"Fellow students!\" you shout, holding up your hands for silence. \"All those who signed up for the human-insect hybridisation program come to front of the hall!\"\n\nYou instruct them to line up according to whichever insect enhancement they desire: one line for wings, another line for antennae, another for hairy legs and so on. \n\nEach student swallows a magical pill the size and shape of a bluebottle and the transformations begin! \n\nYells of laughter and delight fill the great hall as the students sprout translucent wings out of their backs, long probing antennae from their foreheads and grow great ugly black hairs on their legs.\n\nIn no time at all they are zooming through the air, climbing up the walls and leaping from table to table, reveling in their amazing new powers - the age of the superhuman has begun! \n\nBut now it is time for the second - secret - part of your plan.\n\nYou and Daniel sneak back to the magical laboratory as the other kids fool around in the great hall. Even Azog doesn't know what you have planned now.\n\nBack at the laboratory you quickly combine the different DNA serums into a single super fluid and mix in two hairs, freshly plucked from each of your heads. The liquid turns electric blue and froths golden bubbles. \n\nYou pour it into two matching goblets and hand one to Daniel. Clinking the glasses you look Daniel in the eye. \n\n\"See you on the next brain plane.\"\n\n\"I'll drink to that!\" he replies and you both drain your glasses. \n\nThe other students and Azog have all of them been deceived. Into each serum you secretly added some termite DNA which has created a hive mind link directly to your and Daniel's brains, activated by your drink. \n\nThe brain power of all the children has been added to yours making you and Daniel 100 times cleverer than the cleverest person in human history. As an added bonus, every insect, and each student, is now under your direct control.\n\nToo late the children flying around the Great Hall with their fantastic insect wings realise their predicament and their cries of dismay ring out.\n\nYou and Daniel smile at each other, a smile of superman intelligence and understanding.

The older Ravenwings lead the way which is just as well as the route is so complicated you would have never found it on your own.\n\nDown winding stone staircases that never seem to end. Over sloping flagstones that spiral upward for miles. Across innumerable stone courtyards where your steps echo from the walls.\n\nYou pass by magical stained-glass windows in which the colours change over time, making images of dragons breathing flames, or towering magicians leap over tree tops. You walk through dark stone tunnels which are only illuminated by occasional flickering torches.\n\nAt last your heart lifts as your weary feet take you to a stone archway framed in the Ravenwing colours of blue and copper.\n\n\"We've arrived everyone,\" announces a sixth year student from the front of the line. \"First years, welcome to your home away from home for the next six years. Everyone else, welcome back! And remember - it is Wingers only who are allowed in here. The tree won't allow anybody else in.\"\n\n\"What tree?\" you whisper to Daniel. \"Is there a tree blocking the way?\"\n\nDaniel just shrugs his shoulders, his eyes wide.\n\nTogether with the other students you walk under the archway and you notice that the stone is carved in the shape of two intertwined wings. At the top of the arch is a carved-stone raven's head, beak open and pointing downwards.\n\nOn the other side of the arch is a stone staircase which you begin to climb.\n\nAs you climb you notice something strange: the air smells different, warmer somehow. And the stone steps themselves seem to be becoming softer, their edges smoother.\n\nAfter a few more turns of the spiral stone staircase you realise that somehow the stone is morphing into a staircase made out of a single piece of wood. But it doesn't seem to be carved wood. Instead it is wood that has _grown_ into this shape.\n\nYou keep walking upwards until your legs feel too tired to take another step, when at last you emerge into... a vast timber... room? But this enormous space is made of the same strange flowing, growing wood as the staircase. Then you realise where you are and your jaw drops open.\n\nYou and the other Ravenwing students have emerged into the inside of an impossibly giant living tree.\n\nThe hollow inside space - the tree trunk - where you are standing soars up seemingly forever. Living wooden ramps and stairs crisscross the space above your head, and you can see doorways scattered in the trunk at different levels. And lining the inside of the tree trunk for as far as you can see are what must be miles and miles of bookshelves, covered in books of every shape and colour imaginable.\n\n\"Arthur\", says Daniel, \"look at all those _books_!\"\n\n\"That's right youngsters,\" says a kindly looking student a couple of years older than you. \"This is the heart of the Ravenwing House Tower and the heart of the tree: the library. This is the largest library in the world. The largest in the magical _and_ non-magical world,\" he adds proudly. \"Every book that has ever been written and every book that _will ever be written_ is somewhere on these shelves.\"\n\n\"But how do you find the one you want among so many?\" you ask.\n\n\"Easy!\" says the boy. \"Just watch!\"\n\nShaping a small hole with his lips, he lets out a warbling musical whistle. From high up in the trunk there is an answering warble, and you realise that perched up there is a whole flock of emerald green parrots. One of them flies down to your new companion and lands on his shoulder with a gentle squawk.\n\n\"What's your name first year?\" the boy asks you with a smile.\n\n\"Arthur Otley.\"\n\n\"Ok. Polybius, bring me a book by Arthur Otley.\" The parrot launches himself into the air and flies up into the tree trunk.\n\nYou realise that Polybius must be the name of the parrot but you don't understand why the boy is asking for a book written by you. \"But I haven't written any books,\" you explain.\n\n\"You mean you haven't written any books _yet_!\" replies the boy. \"Remember that this library contains _all_ books including those that will be written in the future.\"\n\nWith that Polybius the parrot swoops down through the air, and drops a book from his claws into your hands. You look at the cover, which reads: \"Adventures with Dragons, by Arthur Otley.\"\n\nA huge smile appears on your face. \"You mean I will write this?\" you ask the boy.\n\n\"Of course you will, and if you are not sure _what_ to write, you can just read it to find out.\"\n\nAs your head spins with possibilities, Daniel tugs on your sleeve. \"Hey Arthur, let's go and find our bedrooms.\"\n\nYou allow Daniel to lead you off up one of the spiralling wooden ramps to a doorway high above the tree trunk floor. Above the doorway is a sign saying \"BEDROOMS\".\n\nThe doorway leads to a wide wooden corridor which you realise must be the inside of a branch of this great tree. Every now and again to the left and right are doorways with the names of students written above them. After a short while you come across a doorway that says \"ARTHUR OTLEY\" above it, next to one with \"DANIEL COLLIERS-WOOD\" above it.\n\nYou go in and find yourself in a beautiful cosy little living room with some flow-wood armchairs and a sofa, leading to a spacious bathroom and a bedroom. As you go into the bedroom you can see the sun sinking below the horizon through an open window: the grounds of Hogsnorts School are far below you. At the centre of the bedroom is a luxurious circular bed. On top of the pillow is a foil-wrapped mint chocolate and a little raven cuddly toy.\n\nYou take off your shoes, throw yourself backwards on the bed and munch on the mint chocolate. Yes I think I can be happy here, you say to yourself, as you drift off to sleep with a smile on your face.","choice_1_link":["recrysomwQf8bldIH"],"choice_1_text":"Go to sleep and wake up in the morning","title":"The Ravenwing House Tower","section":"section2-raven","emoji":"üå≥","interface_link":"https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/pagP1bZI9Mlm1p0Vk?khoME=recs9urOxieMUghKl","interface_link_choice_1":["https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/pagP1bZI9Mlm1p0Vk?khoME=recrysomwQf8bldIH"],"choice_1_btn":{"label":"option 1","url":"https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/pagP1bZI9Mlm1p0Vk?khoME=recrysomwQf8bldIH"},"choice_2_btn":{"label":"option 2","url":""},"choice_3_btn":{"label":"option 3","url":""},"choice_4_btn":{"label":"option 4","url":""},"cluster":"school","place":"ravenwing","hyperlink_formula":"school-ravenwing-1-enter-tower","hyperlink_final":"school-ravenwing-1-enter-tower","sequence":"1","choice_5_btn":{"label":"option 5","url":""},"link_text":"enter-tower","autonumber":101,"chrono_num":72,"story_numbers":["recfTGHw8OZqP991D"],"choice_1_storynum":[239],"choice_1_goto":"Go to number 239","story_num":[146],"record_link":"https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/tblY5DZkA8Y5UlgXt/viwInIHzWhN93PDbS/recs9urOxieMUghKl"},{"id":"recmV6B3IR25uFdM1","hyperlink":"school-lesson-2-jokes-jape-s","content":"You raise your hand and most of the other children do the same. \n\n\"Brilliant!\" says Professor Jape, \"How about this one.\"\n\n\"Why do aliens find it so much bother to drink a cup of tea?\"\n\nYou and the other students look politely blank faced. \n\n\"Flying saucers!\" says Jape with a laugh. \"D'you get it?

In ten minutes he's got a hat-trick of hat-tricks. When the game finishes the insects win 28 goals to 21. Now then, after the game the captain of the elephants goes over to congratulate the captain of the insects on their victory.

Good.\" says Professor Knid. \"Now we are all agreed, I can tell you that today we will be studying the marvellous woodlouse. Flies, deliver the woodlice!\"\n\nAt this command, a hundred or so flies detach themselves from Knid's cape, zoom over to a box on the professor's desk and pick up the woodlice, one between four flies. The flies then carry one woodlice to each student and drop it onto the desk in front of them. The flies buzz back to Professor Knid and reattach themselves to his cloak.\n\nThe little woodlouse on your desk appears disturbed at this unexpected flight.

Kensley Potato's ice spell has frozen her desk into a solid block of ice but not touched the woodlouse. Brian Banana (another student from Hedgehog) has tried to make his woodlouse disappear but accidentally lost his wand in the process.\n\n\"The woodlouse, children, as you are discovering, is completely impervious to magic. So if you want to move the woodlouse you must first _understand_ the woodlouse. And the one thing that scares the woodlouse more than anything else is drying out. As soon as they lose their moisture they die. Now - look at this.\"\n\nProfessor Knid raises his wand in an impressively expansive gesture and recites: \"Fiel fresa fusila fuego!\"\n\nA large flame whooshes out of the end of his wand and starts to bake the air around the woodlouse on his desk. Terrified of being dried out, the woodlouse unrolls and scuttles away as fast as he can.\n\n\"So we can see that _indirect_ magic can be powerful against even magic resistant creatures. And we didn't have to harm any arthropods in the process. Now children it's your turn. Wands at the ready!\"\n\nYou look down at your cowering woodlouse and, aiming with your wand, recite the words of the spell: \n\n\"Fiel fresa fusila fuego!\"\n\nFrom the tips of your fingers to the ends of your toes you can feel a powerful magic charge building in your body.

Deliver the woodlice!\"\n\nAt this command, a hundred or so flies detach themselves from Knid's cape, zoom over to a box on the professor's desk and pick up the woodlice, one between four flies. The flies then carry one woodlice to each student and drop it onto the desk in front of them. The flies buzz back to Professor Knid and reattach themselves to his cloak.\n\nThe little woodlouse on your desk appears disturbed at this unexpected flight.

So if you want to move the woodlouse you must first _understand_ the woodlouse. And the one thing that scares the woodlouse more than anything else is drying out. As soon as they lose their moisture they die. Now - look at this.\"\n\nProfessor Knid raises his wand in an impressively expansive gesture and recites: \"Fiel fresa fusila fuego!\"\n\nA large flame whooshes out of the end of his wand and starts to bake the air around the woodlouse on his desk. Terrified of being dried out, the woodlouse unrolls and scuttles away as fast as he can.\n\n\"So we can see that _indirect_ magic can be powerful against even magic resistant creatures.

Above this one it says 'Stare at me and you will see, what you want to come to be.'\n\nAaron relaxes. \"I know what these are! They're mirrors of desire.

Ever since I was a young boy Arthur I have felt an affinity with insects, spiders, crabs. With the Arthropods. A dog will bite you, not so an earwig! A lion may eat you, not so a woodlouse! A human may betray you, a spider will not.\n\n\"My faithful friends growing up were slugs, ants, flies and beetles. But my friends were mercilessly crushed, poisoned, and swatted by humans.\n\n\"The final straw? Slumblebore sat on a spider - and laughed.\"\n\n\"I couldn't bear it. I sought out the Great Spider King Azog himself. What joy when I found him in the forbidden bushes and entered his service. Together we have been gathering supporters here in this dungeon, insects and spiders in their millions. For revenge. For a revolution. To take over the school!\n\n\"No longer will it just be Lionpaw House, Ravenwing House, Snakefang House, and Hedgehog House! We will have a new house mightier than all of them. The Order of the Arthropods! And I will be headmaster.\"\n\n\"But why me?\" fear chills you. \"What has this got to with me?\"\n\n\"You are the only one who can stop us Arthur,\" says the mysterious high pitched voice. \"But with you on our side we will be invincible!\"\n\n\"Who is that?\" you cry. \n\n\"This is the Great Spider King Azog himself.

Arthur Otley is the head of the Order of the Arthropods and he will rule for life.

Don't worry, they told the parents, he's a healthy little chap and the golden belly button doesn't seem to be doing any harm.\n\nNow as this boy grew up he became curious about this golden belly button of his. Why did he have it? What did it mean? Why was it golden? He asked everyone he could but no-one knew: not his teachers at school, not the chief of police, not even the top professors at Oxbridge university. But one day he heard about the wisest man in the world who lived at the top of the tallest mountain far away in the Himalayas.\n\nSo got an aeroplane all the way to India, a bus to the foot of the mountain, a donkey halfway up the mountain, and from there he had to walk, hour after hour in the freezing cold, until he was high above the clouds but still he wasn't at the top. Finally though he reached the top and on the peak was a beautiful temple and sitting in the middle of the temple with his eyes closed was an old man with a great white beard reaching down to his knees.\n\nOh wisest man, said the boy, can you tell me why I have this golden belly button? And the wise old man opened his eyes in wonder and said for many years have I waited for this moment. And from a chain around his neck he held up a golden key. This golden key was exactly the same colour golden as the boy's golden belly button.\n\nThe wise old man put the gold key into the golden belly button and it fitted perfectly. Slowly he turned the key.\n\nThen... the boy's bum fell off.\"\n\nProfessor Jape bursts into uncontrollable high pitched giggling and some of the other children laugh too.\n\n\"His bum, it fell right off!\" shrieked Professor Jape. \"He went all that way and then his bum fell off!

I can see by your question that you are already on the path to enlightenment. Because it is only when we realise that we _don't_ know everything that we can learn.\"\n\nMadame Blavatsky smiles at you. \"And because you are ready to learn I will now teach you your first spell.\"\n\n\"But first can anyone tell me,\" she says addressing the whole class now, \"what is the most common cause of death for wizards and witches? Anyone?\"\n\n\"Broomstick failure?\" suggests Kensley.\n\n\"Poisoned potions?\" proposes another child.\n\n\"Manitees? Dragons? Ghouls?\"\n\n\"No, no and no again.\" replies Professor Blavatsky. \"The one thing that is most likely to kill you more than anything else is: each other.\"\n\n\"Let me explain. Imagine it is night time, 3am in the morning. You hear a noise downstairs. Immediately you are on the alert. It could be burglars. Or more likely dark wizards on the attack. You creep downstairs, wand at the ready. You can hear them rummaging around in the kitchen. You leap out shouting the most deadly spells you can think of. Only to discover... it is your Uncle Brian who is visiting for the weekend and has come down in the night to help himself to a biscuit. Now he is paralysed on the kitchen floor, a look of horror on his face and the packet of biscuits grasped so tightly in his hand that no-one else will be eating them ever again.\"\n\n\"Yes I'm afraid to say that the most common cause of death is 'friendly fire', accidentally hitting your friends and family with dangerous or deadly spells. The sad fact is that you are all in far more danger from each other than from any evil sorcerer. Which is why the spell I am going to teach you to protect against dark magic is a sleeping spell. It is one I designed myself. The benefit of this spell is that it is completely reversible. To wake someone up, you just need to tickle them under their armpits.\"\n\nBlavatsky then whips out her wand and points it at Kensley.\n\n\"Somnolencia salchicha sabrosa!\" she screams.\n\nA dart of pure golden light shoots out of the end of her wand and hits Kensley right in the middle of his forehead. In less than a half a second her head has sunk down to her arms on his desk and she is snoring like a sailor.\n\nThe class breaks out into a round of applause.\n\n\"Make sure you get the pronunciation just right when you cast the spell\" Blavataksy advises as she walks over to Kensley and tickles her under the armpits.\n\n\"Ha ha ha! What happened?\" says Kensley, confused.\n\nThe class splits into pairs and you practice sending each other to sleep. Because Kensely is still a bit drowsy you go first, pointing your wand at her forehead just as the teacher did:\n\n\"Somnolencia salchicha sabrosa...\" you repeat carefully.\n\nYou sense an unnerving feeling of magical power gathering in your tummy. In an instant it has whooshed up out of your arm, channelled by the wand into a golden dart that zaps Kensely on the head, for the second time in as many minutes.\n\nIn no time at all she is asleep and snoring again.\n\n\"I did it!\" you shout. \"It worked!\"\n\nDelighted with your success you tickle Kensley under the armpits. As she wakes up giggling you try hard to memorise the spell 'Somnolencia salchicha sabrosa' - you never know when it may come in handy.","choice_1_link":["recN0aHKoxG7E2HBz"],"status":"Done","choice_1_text":"Murmuring the words of the spell to yourself, you go back to the school hall.","title":"Spelling trouble","section":"section2-hogger","emoji":"üç™","interface_link":"https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/pagP1bZI9Mlm1p0Vk?khoME=reckWOLrsQ7V48aIP","interface_link_choice_1":["https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/pagP1bZI9Mlm1p0Vk?khoME=recN0aHKoxG7E2HBz"],"choice_1_btn":{"label":"option 1","url":"https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/pagP1bZI9Mlm1p0Vk?khoME=recN0aHKoxG7E2HBz"},"choice_2_btn":{"label":"option 2","url":""},"choice_3_btn":{"label":"option 3","url":""},"choice_4_btn":{"label":"option 4","url":""},"cluster":"school","place":"hogger","hyperlink_formula":"school-hogger-3-spells-blavat","hyperlink_final":"school-lionpaw-3-spells-blavat-h","sequence":"3","choice_5_btn":{"label":"option 5","url":""},"link_text":"spells-blavat","autonumber":385,"chrono_num":86,"story_numbers":["rec6AOqdd9qsvMEk4"],"choice_1_storynum":[135],"choice_1_goto":"Go to number 135","story_num":[186],"record_link":"https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/tblY5DZkA8Y5UlgXt/viwInIHzWhN93PDbS/reckWOLrsQ7V48aIP"},{"id":"recneyU0x7csPEiuL","hyperlink":"school-lesson-2-insects-knid-h","content":"You raise your hand and ask \"Aren't hedgehogs better than insects?

Insects have been flying for over 350 million years! And to think we are always _so impressed_ by the birds. Look at me, look at my feathers, I'm a bird! But insects have been flying for twice as long as birds - birds only evolved 150 million years ago. Pathetic.\n\n\"Secondly: a hedgehog may eat an insect, but after a hedgehog dies who has the last laugh? Insects that's who. Insects, working together will devour the hedgehog carcass until nothing is left, not even the bones. If it wasn't for insects we would have dead hedgehogs all over the place - you would be tripping over them every time you went out of your front door!\n\n\"Thirdly: how many hedgehogs are there in the world? Not many I can tell you. Or how many mammals even? All the hedgehogs, deer, humans, rabbits and elephants put together?\n\nMammals make up only 0.4% of all animal species.\n\nInsects species make up 70% of all animal species, and if we include all arthropods that's over 80%. That means for every one mammal species (like a hedgehog) there are _more than 170 insect species_.\n\n\"No, it is clear to me, as it should now be clear to you, that hedgehogs are pitiful, almost inconsequential creatures compared to insects and arthropods.\"\n\n\"But sir,\" interrupts Kensley, \"insects _are_ disgusting...\"\n\n\"Oh the cheek of it!

Through dingy underground stone tunnels lit only by the occasional flickering torch. Up and down stone staircases with steps which sometimes seem built for a giant, and you have to clamber up one at a time, and at other times seem built for a gnome and you almost trip over them they are so small. \n\nBut at last you can sense from the excited chatter of the other students that you are getting closer. It also seems to be getting warmer - the cold dank of the school corridors has been replaced by a dry heat radiating from the walls. \n\nFinally you reach a stone archway painted in the Snakefang House colours of silver and green.\n\n\"We're here Snakefangs, our home sweet home,\" states one of the older boys. \"Everyone remember that only Snakefangs are allowed in the House Tower. Anyone else who tries to enter will get swallowed by the Blood Squirter, if they even get that far!\" The children give a low chuckle. \n\n\"What's the Blood Squirter?\" you whisper to Snako.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he whispers back with a bloodthirsty grin, \"but whatever it is, it sounds super cool.\"\n\n\"In we go then!\" commands the older boy and you all file through the arch. As you pass through you realise the arch is carved in the shape of an enormous open snake's mouth, its fangs dripping down like giant stalactites.\n\nWhen you enter the tower your mouth drops open as you are confronted by a fantastic, almost otherworldly scene.\n\nYou are in a wide circular space paved with a shiny black stone. It is walled all around with a stone wall that rises upwards for as far as you can see, leaving a small circle of open sky at the top. It would be dark if it wasn't for the pool in the middle of this strange courtyard.\n\nThat's because the pool is full of glowing orange lava. \n\nThis must be the source of the heat you noticed in the corridor as you approached the tower. And basking on the edges of the lava pool are some huge snakes, each a different colour. \n\n\"This is so cool,\" you say to Snako, and walk forwards to get a closer look. When you reach the pool of lava, one of the snakes lifts his head (as big as yours) and flickers his tongue out in your direction. You carefully reach out a hand and stroke the snake's scaly chin. He makes a satisfied hissing noise. \n\n\"I can see he likes you,\" says an older girl who has walked over. \"Say hello to Blood Squirter.\"\n\n\"So this is Blood Squirter - what a beautiful creature!\" You turn to the girl:  \"This place is amazing, I love the snakes, the lava lake... But it doesn't look very... comfortable. Where does everyone sit down for a rest or to go to sleep?\"\n\n\"This is just the central courtyard of the tower,\" shrugs the girl. \"We don't hang out here much, it's mainly for the snakes or when we want to toast marshmallows. No - around the edge of this big tower everyone has their own personal smaller tower which you can get to by climbing the stairs.\"\n\nYou look at where the girl is gesturing and realise that this giant tower has a long stone staircase winding its way up the inside of the wall. Every now and again the staircase has a small landing leading to a locked door. \n\n\"You mean I have a tower _just for me_?\" you ask, your eyes wide, and the girl nods.\n\n\"We have got to check this out,\" you say to Snako and the two of you run over to the stone staircase. As you climb you pass the locked doors that you noticed earlier and you see that each one has a name above them: Gertrude Viper-Collins, Bartholomew Beetlebottom, Lyra Poisonwood read a few.\n\nAfter you have climbed the staircase high above the lava pool you notice two doors next to each other. Above one it says Snako Malboy and above the other Arthur Otley. You notice a much smaller sign next to the door too, which reads: 'Insert wand into key hole'. \n\nWith a thrill of excitement you slowly put the end of your wand into the keyhole of the door. After a moment the whole doorway is outlined in a magical golden glow and then - without a sound - the door swings inwards. At the door next to you Snako has done the same. \n\nYou and Snako take a deep breath, nod goodbye to each other, and enter.\n\nYou find yourself in the most wonderful room.\n\nWhereas the courtyard below was bare and dim, this place is comfortable, light and airy. There are two or three sofas and comfy armchairs scattered around, tall windows on the room, looking down on the Hogsnorts School grounds, and a low table in front of the fireplace. You notice that the fireplace contains a little bubbling pool of lava, no doubt fed from the same source deep below the earth as the lava pool you saw earlier. A large TV and games console are nestled next to a window.\n\nKicking your shoes off and bouncing down onto a sofa, you notice a spiral iron staircase leading up to the second floor above you and realise that the girl you were talking to before was absolutely right. This is a _whole tower_ just for you. The main Snakefang House Tower must be studded with hundreds of student towers, sprouting out the side of it like mushrooms.\n\nRacing up the spiral iron staircase you find yourself in a large circular study room with a curved desk against one wall, some bookshelves against another, and a set of cupboards fully stocked with potent magical ingredients.\n\nThe next floor is a small kitchen with a magically replenishing larder to one side. Above that is the bathroom with a huge bath in the middle, propped up on four iron feet cast in the shape of snakes baring their fangs.\n\nAbove _this_ is the bedroom, and above the bedroom under the sloping tower roof is a little astronomical observatory, complete with telescope.\n\nComing back down to the bedroom, you lie back on the enormous four-poster bed and crunch on a mint flavoured chocolate that you found on your pillow, next to a cuddly toy snake.\n\nThrough the window outside you can see the sun sinking slowly below the horizon. \n\nYou put your hands behind your head and smile. Yes, I could be happy here, you say to yourself as you slip into a deep untroubled sleep.","choice_1_link":["reclXTtcSWCYmqBkp"],"choice_1_text":"Go to sleep and wake up in the morning","title":"The Snakefang House Tower","section":"section2-snake","emoji":"üåã","interface_link":"https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/pagP1bZI9Mlm1p0Vk?khoME=recDn7yA9Nol7bChj","interface_link_choice_1":["https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/pagP1bZI9Mlm1p0Vk?khoME=reclXTtcSWCYmqBkp"],"choice_1_btn":{"label":"option 1","url":"https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/pagP1bZI9Mlm1p0Vk?khoME=reclXTtcSWCYmqBkp"},"choice_2_btn":{"label":"option 2","url":""},"choice_3_btn":{"label":"option 3","url":""},"choice_4_btn":{"label":"option 4","url":""},"cluster":"school","place":"snakefang","hyperlink_formula":"school-snakefang-1-enter-tower","hyperlink_final":"school-snakefang-1-enter-tower","sequence":"1","choice_5_btn":{"label":"option 5","url":""},"link_text":"enter-tower","autonumber":104,"chrono_num":72,"story_numbers":["recrUcYlLEY3VHvN8"],"choice_1_storynum":[213],"choice_1_goto":"Go to number 213","story_num":[201],"record_link":"https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/tblY5DZkA8Y5UlgXt/viwInIHzWhN93PDbS/recDn7yA9Nol7bChj"},{"id":"recYliubjEv4yU5Tq","hyperlink":"beetle-bottle-h","content":"Tweetle beetle bottle battle!\" you cry as you round the corner with Kensley just behind you. \n\nAiming your wand at the beetles... nothing happens.\n\n\"What's your plan Arthur?\" shouts Kensley.\n\n\"I don't know!

Good.\" says Professor Knid. \"Now we are all agreed, I can tell you that today we will be studying the marvellous woodlouse. Flies, deliver the woodlice!\"\n\nAt this command, a hundred or so flies detach themselves from Knid's cape, zoom over to a box on the professor's desk and pick up the woodlice, one between four flies. The flies then carry one woodlice to each student and drop it onto the desk in front of them. The flies buzz back to Professor Knid and reattach themselves to his cloak.\n\nThe little woodlouse on your desk appears disturbed at this unexpected flight.

The sparkles hit the woodlouse... and bounce right off! The woodlouse is unmoved.\n\nLooking around the classroom you can see that the other children are having no more success than you did.\n\nKensley's ice spell has frozen her desk into a solid block of ice but not touched the woodlouse. Brian Banana (another student from Hedgehog) has tried to make his woodlouse disappear but accidentally lost his wand in the process. Snako has singed his own eyebrows when his lightning spell bounced off the woodlouse and hit him in the face. \n\n\"The woodlouse, children, as you are discovering, is completely impervious to magic. So if you want to move the woodlouse you must first _understand_ the woodlouse. And the one thing that scares the woodlouse more than anything else is drying out. As soon as they lose their moisture they die. Now - look at this.\"\n\nProfessor Knid raises his wand in an impressively expansive gesture and recites: \"Fiel fresa fusila fuego!\"\n\nA large flame whooshes out of the end of his wand and starts to bake the air around the woodlouse on his desk. Terrified of being dried out, the woodlouse unrolls and scuttles away as fast as he can.\n\n\"So we can see that _indirect_ magic can be powerful against even magic resistant creatures. And we didn't have to harm any arthropods in the process. Now children it's your turn.

Then with a feeling like a bit like doing a wee the magic zooms along your arm and out of your wand in a very impressive jet of flame. \n\nYou are delighted at the result, the first time you have cast such a wonderful spell! And a fire spell could be used for so many things - like roasting marshmallows or boiling the kettle.\n\nThe woodlouse feels the magical flames heat the air and desk around him, and scarpers.\n\n\"I did it!\" you murmur with quiet satisfaction, and commit the words of the spell to your memory: fiel fresa fusila fuego.","choice_1_link":["recN0aHKoxG7E2HBz"],"status":"Done","choice_1_text":"Feeling delighted you head back to the hall to decide what to do next","title":"Knid's spell","section":"section2-hogger","emoji":"üî•","interface_link":"https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/pagP1bZI9Mlm1p0Vk?khoME=recT1tUcrM0Zzs3nI","interface_link_choice_1":["https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/pagP1bZI9Mlm1p0Vk?khoME=recN0aHKoxG7E2HBz"],"choice_1_btn":{"label":"option 1","url":"https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/pagP1bZI9Mlm1p0Vk?khoME=recN0aHKoxG7E2HBz"},"choice_2_btn":{"label":"option 2","url":""},"choice_3_btn":{"label":"option 3","url":""},"choice_4_btn":{"label":"option 4","url":""},"cluster":"school","place":"lesson","hyperlink_formula":"school-lesson-3-spells-knid","hyperlink_final":"school-lesson-3-spells-knid-h","sequence":"3","choice_5_btn":{"label":"option 5","url":""},"link_text":"spells-knid","autonumber":375,"chrono_num":83,"story_numbers":["rec8PE1AQCGlb06yA"],"choice_1_storynum":[135],"choice_1_goto":"Go to number 135","story_num":[203],"record_link":"https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/tblY5DZkA8Y5UlgXt/viwInIHzWhN93PDbS/recT1tUcrM0Zzs3nI"},{"id":"recKwffcnp5FYPrM7","hyperlink":"eric-knid-explains-r","content":"A voice, strong and commanding, emerges from the darkness. \"One of you?

All the first years are chattering to each other, excited to visit their house tower for the first time.\n\nYour route twists and turns, down passageways and corridors, through archways and cloisters. At times you pass by stained glass windows that stretch far up to the high ceiling and coloured light streams through the passageway. At other times the stone lined walls are dark and low with just the occasional torch flickering from the wall to illuminate your passage.\n\nAt last the line of Lionpaw students arrives at an archway framed in brilliant blue and gleaming gold.\n\n\"Well Lionpaws!\" shouts out an older girl at the front of the line. \"We have arrived at Lionpaw House tower! First years, this will be your home for the next 6 years - remember that only Lionpaws can pass this archway, so if you have any friends in other houses...\" there are boos and laughter from the children at this remark \"...you will have to _fraternize_ elsewhere! Into the Lion's den everyone!\"\n\nWith that she turns and leads you all inside. \n\nYou realise that the stone archway is carved in the shape of a lion's open mouth, with sharp stone fangs hanging down like stalagmites. \n\nWhen you pass through the archway you can't help but stop and stare, your mouth hanging open almost as wide as the lion's jaws you have just passed through.\n\nYou are confronted by a large bright circular space. Dangling from the ceiling far above are golden globes enchanted with a magico-flourescent light that illuminates a patterned marble floor. As you enter the room a handful of spell-bound goat-sized magical snails swivel their eyes stalks in your direction - doomed to forever slither the marble flagstones, the snails buff them to a gleaming brightness as they go. Scattered around are luxurious sofas, comfy armchairs and expensive rugs. \n\nDoorways leading to staircases are spaced at regular intervals around this enormous room. Above each doorway is a little sign and you read some of them:\n\n\"Bedrooms. Snack store. Swimming Pool. Virtual reality gaming room. Sauna. Infinity Pools. Steam Room....\" you look at Aaron. \"Did you know about this? This place is amazing!\"\n\nAlex Bleazely, Aaron's older brother hears you: \"Listen Arthur, if Hogsnorts is going to attract the best talent and compete with the top international universities like Yale, Cambridge, Dorkstrang and Hull we need the best facilities. Right, I'm going to change into my swimming trunks - last one in the Jacuzzi is an eggy drifter!\"\n\nAlex and Robert Bleezely dash off, followed by two or three other Lionpaw students, whooping and hollering.\n\n\"Let's go and find our bedrooms Arthur,\" says Aaron.\n\nYou go up the staircase marked \"Bedrooms\" and when you reach the next floor you see two more doorways, one with a sign saying \"Arthur\" above it and another with an \"Aaron\" sign. By some magical warping of space the inside of the Lionpaw House tower must be much bigger than the outside.\n\nYou push open the door to your bedroom.\n\nA softly carpeted corridor opens onto a cozy little living room. Another door leads to a spacious bathroom containing a large bathtub with four carved iron lion feet at each corner. Finally your bedroom itself, in the centre of which is a giant four-poster bed, festooned with blue and gold drapes. On the pillow is a cuddly little toy lion and a small mint chocolate. A window in your bedrooms looks out over the Hogsnorts school grounds far below where the sun is sinking below the horizon.\n\nYou take off your shoes and jump backwards onto the bed. I could be happy here you think to yourself as you crunch up the mint chocolate - already it feels like home.

How will you even find the way to the dungeons?\n\nJust then you notice five spiders walking along the floor, lined up one after the other. What are those curious little creatures up to? you think, and start to follow them along the corridor.\n\nThey turn left, right, right again, then left before disappearing under a crack in the doorway.\n\nYou look up. Above the door is a sign scrawled in thick black letters: DUNGEONS.\n\n\"This is it!\" you whisper to Daniel, afraid to speak too loud in the silence. You reach out to turn the great brass doorknob and open the door. But it doesn't budge, and as you pull on the doorknob the edge of the door glows golden.\n\n\"Look!\" says Daniel to you quietly, \"The door is enchanted with an enchantment of locking. We'll never open it if we don't know the magic password. We need to figure out a way to get the password if we are going to get inside.\"\n\nAt that moment you hear lots of footsteps coming your way from around a corner. It must be a group of students on their way to their house tower! Before you have time to hide, they turn the corner and spot you.\n\n\"Arthur and Daniel isn't it? What are you two doing there, exploring the castle already? Come on back into line!\" To your surprise you are addressed by one of the older Ravenwing students. You must have somehow taken a hidden shortcut when following the spiders.","choice_1_link":["recs9urOxieMUghKl"],"status":"Done","choice_1_text":"You head back into the line and head off into the passageway with the rest of the students.

Kensley doesn't notice and walks on, but the _thing_ bounces and then rolls down the corridor towards you, stopping at your feet.\n\nYou bend down and pick it up. It is a ring of pure gold.\n\nHow curious, you think.\n\nEven more curious, you can just make out some tiny writing engraved on the surface of the ring, which says:\n\n::: text-poem\n_One Ring to trick them all,  \nOne Ring to cloud you,  \nOne Ring to fool them all,  \nIn ghostly darkness shroud you._\n:::\n\nBut there is no time to worry about mysterious rings: you breathe deeply and plunge forwards past the woodlouse army who are delving into the still moist cracks in the stone.\n\nAfter walking further down the dank, chilly passage you come to a door made of iron bars.\n\nJust beyond you can hear a faint murmur of voices.\n\nThis is it: the heart of the dungeon. Whoever or whatever has been setting these traps for you and Kensley must be here, at the bottom of it all.","choice_1_link":["recjGX4xRt06yEKx5"],"status":"Done","choice_1_text":"You push open the door and go inside.","title":"The heart of the dungeon","section":"section2-hogger","emoji":"‚ù§Ô∏è","interface_link":"https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/pagP1bZI9Mlm1p0Vk?khoME=recTfTpOWAKP4AIwJ","interface_link_choice_1":["https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/pagP1bZI9Mlm1p0Vk?khoME=recjGX4xRt06yEKx5"],"choice_1_btn":{"label":"option 1","url":"https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/pagP1bZI9Mlm1p0Vk?khoME=recjGX4xRt06yEKx5"},"choice_2_btn":{"label":"option 2","url":""},"choice_3_btn":{"label":"option 3","url":""},"choice_4_btn":{"label":"option 4","url":""},"hyperlink_final":"dungeon-heart-h","choice_5_btn":{"label":"option 5","url":""},"autonumber":362,"chrono_num":117,"story_numbers":["recw5JChdHAuIuGl8"],"choice_1_storynum":[255],"choice_1_goto":"Go to number 255","story_num":[233],"record_link":"https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/tblY5DZkA8Y5UlgXt/viwInIHzWhN93PDbS/recTfTpOWAKP4AIwJ"},{"id":"recUaSJByg8RhOOZQ","hyperlink":"slumbledore-office-instructions-r","content":"\"I will do it, though I do not know how,\" you say. \n\n\"My dear Arthur!

The windows look onto vegetable gardens on one side and some overgrown brambles on the other.\n\nYou walk into the class with Snako and sit down. For this lesson Snakefang House first years have combined with Hedgehog House first years. Kensley Potato - a first year Hogger - sits down on your other side and starts fiddling with her pencil case. \n\nProfessor Knid stands at the front patiently while the children settle. His long arms and legs poke out of his wizard's gown. A strange shimmery cloak dangles from his shoulders. Dressed all in black he looks rather like an overgrown spider.\n\nWhen there is silence he raises his hands. His odd looking cloak flutters around him while he speaks:\n\n\"Today you will learn about the care of magical creatures.\n\n\"But before we do that let me take this opportunity to remind you of Slumblebore's warning at the house sorting dinner.\" Professor Knid looks out at the class with a piercing gaze and it appears to you that his eyes are focused directly on you.\n\n\"No-one must go into the dungeons this term. There is something mysterious and very probably dangerous down there this term, and no-one is allowed to interrupt. Is that clear?\"\n\nNods all round from the class. You exchange raised eyebrows with Snako. What could be going on down there? And why was Professor Knid staring straight at you?\n\n\"Right!\" Knid claps his hands.\"Can anyone tell me the most common type of magical creature?\"\n\n\"Unicorns?\" shouts out one boy.\n\n\"Witches cats!\" shouts a girl at the back. \n\n\"Flying monkeys!\" shouts someone else. \n\n\"These are all good answers. But not correct. The most common type of magical creature is the insect, or, more generally: the arthropod. Spiders, snails, flies, ants, beetles, woodlice, these are all infinitely more common than the unicorn. And many of them have been enchanted by a magician or witch at some point in the past making them effectively immortal until trodden on. \n\n\"For example, look closely at my cloak children.\" Eric Knid walks up and down the class so the children can see better.\n\nYou realise that the professor's cloak is not merely shimmering, it is _moving_. It seems to be made up of lots of tiny moving _things_. Then you realise what they are and your eyes widen in hideous fascination.\n\nEric Knid's cloak is made up of thousands upon thousands of flies, each fly grasping the flies next to it with their tiny hairy legs. As they flutter their wings or move their black and iridescent green bodies, the cloak appears to undulate as if in a breeze. \n\nTo you and the rest of the class it seems revolting, but Professor Knid is oblivious.\n\n\"Until you look closely my cloak is just an ordinary magician's cape. But it is actually made up of thousands of enchanted and specially trained flies. And each one can fly off at my command to do my bidding - to deliver a message perhaps, or sit on someone's dinner, or to distract a powerful wizard in the act of casting a spell.\n\n\"Yes the insect world is a vast and overlooked wonder and in this lesson I am going to teach you about a tiny portion of it.\n\n\"But before we learn any magic, does anyone doubt me that the arthropods - the insects - are the true marvels of the animal world?\"\n\nProfessor Knid looks round expectantly, his eyebrows raised.","choice_1_link":["recj9R3OhVs8Z1aAn"],"status":"Done","choice_2_link":["recfZeS0AoxORNNH9"],"choice_1_text":"You don't like insects that much.

The windows look onto vegetable gardens on one side and some overgrown brambles on the other.\n\nYou walk into the class with Aaron and sit down. For this lesson Lionpaw House first years have combined with Hedgehog House first years. Kensley Potato - a first year Hogger - sits down on your other side and starts fiddling with her pencil case. \n\nProfessor Knid stands at the front patiently while the children settle. His long arms and legs poke out of his wizard's gown. A strange shimmery cloak dangles from his shoulders. Dressed all in black he looks rather like an overgrown spider.\n\nWhen there is silence he raises his hands. His odd looking cloak flutters around him while he speaks:\n\n\"Today you will learn about the care of magical creatures.\n\n\"But before we do that let me take this opportunity to remind you of Slumblebore's warning at the house sorting dinner.\" Professor Knid looks out at the class with a piercing gaze and it appears to you that his eyes are focused directly on you.\n\n\"No-one must go into the dungeons this term. There is something mysterious and very probably dangerous down there this term, and no-one is allowed to interrupt. Is that clear?\"\n\nNods all round from the class. You exchange raised eyebrows with Aaron. What could be going on down there? And why was Professor Knid staring straight at you?\n\n\"Right!\" Knid claps his hands.\"Can anyone tell me the most common type of magical creature?\"\n\n\"Unicorns?\" shouts out one boy.\n\n\"Witches cats!\" shouts a girl at the back. \n\n\"Flying monkeys!\" shouts someone else. \n\n\"These are all good answers. But not correct. The most common type of magical creature is the insect, or, more generally: the arthropod. Spiders, snails, flies, ants, beetles, woodlice, these are all infinitely more common than the unicorn. And many of them have been enchanted by a magician or witch at some point in the past making them effectively immortal until trodden on. \n\n\"For example, look closely at my cloak children.\" Eric Knid walks up and down the class so the children can see better.\n\nYou realise that the professor's cloak is not merely shimmering, it is _moving_. It seems to be made up of lots of tiny moving _things_. Then you realise what they are and your eyes widen in hideous fascination.\n\nEric Knid's cloak is made up of thousands upon thousands of flies, each fly grasping the flies next to it with their tiny hairy legs. As they flutter their wings or move their black and iridescent green bodies, the cloak appears to undulate as if in a breeze. \n\nTo you and the rest of the class it seems revolting, but Professor Knid is oblivious.\n\n\"Until you look closely my cloak is just an ordinary magician's cape. But it is actually made up of thousands of enchanted and specially trained flies. And each one can fly off at my command to do my bidding - to deliver a message perhaps, or sit on someone's dinner, or to distract a powerful wizard in the act of casting a spell.\n\n\"Yes the insect world is a vast and overlooked wonder and in this lesson I am going to teach you about a tiny portion of it.\n\n\"But before we learn any magic, does anyone doubt me that the arthropods - the insects - are the true marvels of the animal world?\"\n\nProfessor Knid looks round expectantly, his eyebrows raised.","choice_1_link":["recc5RbxFllGRVLg9"],"choice_2_link":["rec8vi81TYhc1128e"],"choice_1_text":"You don't like insects that much.

Look you can see their legs are still moving.\"\n\nThey must be dreaming some pleasant beetle dream, perhaps of cantering through a leafy carboniferous glade, as their legs make little wiggles in the air.\n\n\"Let's get past them before they wake up.\"\n\nYou and Snako step over the sleeping beetles, giving them a kick as you walk past. That will teach them for attacking you.\n\nYou descend a spiral staircase now and the air is getting dank and stale. It can't be long before you arrive in the dungeon. \n\nAt the bottom of the staircase it is pitch black.\n\nYou raise your wand and the tip emits a faint golden light, just enough to see by.\n\nYou almost wish you hadn't. \n\nRevealed by the dim light of your wand you can see the floor and the walls are completely covered in woodlice. Millions upon millions of them cling to the damp stone slabs that make up the corridor. Millions more cover the flagstones, waving their repulsive little antennae. Others have curled up into balls and are rolling around irresponsibly.\n\nDo woodlice even have eyes? You don't know but when you turned on your light they all seemed to turn and look at you. \n\n\"Slithering snakebites Arthur, what are we going to do? There are too many of them to fight!\"\n\n\"Don't move a muscle Snako\" you say in reply. \"I have an idea.\"","choice_1_link":["recxLnNzasoyIgjCX"],"status":"Done","choice_2_link":["reciZhmJbQcjqGLmf"],"choice_1_text":"You chant the spell \"Fiel fresa fusila fuego.\"","choice_2_text":"You recite the incantation \"Amansa at√∫n!\"","title":"Woodlouse warfare","section":"section2-snake","emoji":"ü™ñ","interface_link":"https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/pagP1bZI9Mlm1p0Vk?khoME=recv0EYpFiNqUFtkP","interface_link_choice_2":["https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/pagP1bZI9Mlm1p0Vk?khoME=reciZhmJbQcjqGLmf"],"interface_link_choice_1":["https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/pagP1bZI9Mlm1p0Vk?khoME=recxLnNzasoyIgjCX"],"choice_1_btn":{"label":"option 1","url":"https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/pagP1bZI9Mlm1p0Vk?khoME=recxLnNzasoyIgjCX"},"choice_2_btn":{"label":"option 2","url":"https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/pagP1bZI9Mlm1p0Vk?khoME=reciZhmJbQcjqGLmf"},"choice_4_link":["recrbzxqR9u6qILPw"],"choice_3_link":["recYJZ4wU67tLhspX"],"interface_link_choice_3":["https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/pagP1bZI9Mlm1p0Vk?khoME=recYJZ4wU67tLhspX"],"interface_link_choice_4":["https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/pagP1bZI9Mlm1p0Vk?khoME=recrbzxqR9u6qILPw"],"choice_3_btn":{"label":"option 3","url":"https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/pagP1bZI9Mlm1p0Vk?khoME=recYJZ4wU67tLhspX"},"choice_4_btn":{"label":"option 4","url":"https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/pagP1bZI9Mlm1p0Vk?khoME=recrbzxqR9u6qILPw"},"choice_3_text":"You shout out \"Dispara dinosaurio demente!\"","choice_4_text":"You decide that you will just walk forwards and crush the woodlice underfoot.","hyperlink_final":"woodlouse-warfare-s","choice_5_link":["rec6kmVzzhvYK1BuE"],"choice-5-text":"You don't know the first thing about combating woodlice.

Not while you still have a clear head and a straight wand will you let these insects take over! You are going to fight them every step of the way, starting with Azog!\n\nAzog is too nimble to be caught so easily though and leaps out of the way.\n\n\"You will regret your choice Arthur,\" screams the spider king in outrage. \"Insects, attack!\"\n\nFrom out of cracks in the walls, ceiling and floor crawl millions upon millions of arthropods: beetles, woodlice, ants, millipedes, earwigs, spiders in a great stream heading straight for you.\n\nThis time you don't hesitate. If you stay you will be surrounded and overwhelmed.\n\n\"Daniel, run!\" you say as you turn and flee. \n\nYour heart pounding, you and Daniel run back out of the dungeon up towards the school. You have a plan.\n\nWhen you reach the enchanted door that leads down into the dungeon you dash through, Daniel just behind you, and slam it shut. You can hear the enchanted locking mechanism clicking shut.\n\nThere's only one way for the insects to get past the door now - through the keyhole. You turn and wait, your wand at the ready. Daniel stands next to you, prepared.\n\nAs soon as you see the first hairy little leg poking out of the keyhole you use your wand as a flamethrower shouting \"fiel fresa fusila fuego\" again and again until your voice is hoarse. Daniel joins you adding his flames to yours.\n\nThe air is full of the harsh high pitched cries of dying arthropods and the sizzle of roasting chitin. But still the insects come, propelled onwards by the Great Azog's iron will.\n\nYou and Daniel are getting tired now, your arm is sore from being held up so long and you can feel your reserves of magical energy running out. You cannot hold out much longer.\n\nFor a moment the magical fire from your wand flickers and dies.\n\nThen three things happen simultaneously: \n\nOne: Azog, sensing his chance, launches himself through the keyhole aiming straight for your face. \n\nTwo: Slumblebore runs round the corner to see you battling the numberless insect foe on your own.\n\nThree: your faltering spell was a ruse. You have enough magical power for one last enchantment, but this time it won't be a fireball...\n\n\"Somnolencia salchicha sabrosa!\" you cry pointing at your wand at Azog as he flies through the air towards you.\n\nThen...\n\nAzog, leaping through the air fangs at the ready, is unable to change direction. Just as your wand arm comes _up_ he reaches the tip of the wand, and has no time to avoid the sleep spell which blasts him right in the middle of his eight little compound eyes.\n\nEven the great Azog cannot withstand such a concentrated blast of magic at point blank range. He is blasted backwards, fast asleep and snoring before he even hits the stone wall behind him. \n\nWith Azog out of action the rest of the arthropod horde lose all cohesion. When Slumblebore cautiously opens the door to the dungeon they are fleeing in all directions, and will trouble the school no more. Slumblebore lets off a few more blasts of fire to encourage them on their way.\n\n\"You did it Arthur!\" cries Daniel. \"You saved the school - the evil has gone - and you have captured Azog alive!\"\n\nYou stand still and listen carefully. Daniel is right. You cannot sense the insects any longer. The dungeons have been cleansed.\n\n\"Well done indeed Arthur,\" and Slumblebore, turning back to you. \"I had a feeling that you were the special one. Without you I fear we would have been overrun by insects by now.\"\n\n\"It was Eric Knid,\" you say to Slumblebore. \"It was Professor Knid who summoned the insect army, with Azog the spider king. He is down in the dungeon now unconscious. Azog bit him.\"\n\n\"Eric did you say? Well I'm not surprised. He always struck me as a bit of an odd fish. Nevermind we will pick him up in the morning and I shall give him an official reprimand. And if he does it again I will have no choice but to put him on a performance improvement plan.\"\n\n\"But you Arthur, what else can I give _you_ but my most heartfelt thanks.\" You can't suppress a broad grin. You did it! You defeated Azog and his insect army single handed, using your magical strength and cleverness!\n\nSlumbelbore continues: \"You truly are a hero Arthur, a hero of Hogsnorts School.\"","choice_1_link":["rec3RosYEL9bVsx83"],"status":"Done","choice_1_text":"The next day...","title":"School hero","section":"section2-raven","emoji":"üéì","interface_link":"https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/pagP1bZI9Mlm1p0Vk?khoME=rec6AE5ayPZfTQFNJ","interface_link_choice_1":["https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/pagP1bZI9Mlm1p0Vk?khoME=rec3RosYEL9bVsx83"],"choice_1_btn":{"label":"option 1","url":"https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/pagP1bZI9Mlm1p0Vk?khoME=rec3RosYEL9bVsx83"},"choice_2_btn":{"label":"option 2","url":""},"choice_3_btn":{"label":"option 3","url":""},"choice_4_btn":{"label":"option 4","url":""},"hyperlink_final":"choose-hero-r","choice_5_btn":{"label":"option 5","url":""},"autonumber":349,"chrono_num":121,"story_numbers":["recnIWFqqxCfo5zbd"],"choice_1_storynum":[136],"choice_1_goto":"Go to number 136","story_num":[260],"record_link":"https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/tblY5DZkA8Y5UlgXt/viwInIHzWhN93PDbS/rec6AE5ayPZfTQFNJ"},{"id":"receF3Wd9RTOfEqKV","hyperlink":"slumblebore-office-second-thoughts","content":"You leap out of the clock just in time, you could already feel the magic sucking you down.\n\nBreathing hard you look back at the clock face and see the hands of the clock spinning madly backwards.\n\n\"You have changed your mind about changing your mind have you?\" Slumblebore observes, his bushy eyebrows raised. \"Well you can come and see me at any time and change your mind again if you want.\"\n\n\"I...

In the past students would be imprisoned in the dungeons for misbehaviour. Now they are mainly used to store broken chairs and Christmas decorations. But we go down there so infrequently there is no telling what evil is brewing in some dark corner.\"\n\n\"I advise you to keep your wand at the ready and your wits sharp Arthur. And remember all the lessons the teachers have taught you. You will be put to the test and I do not know how it will turn out.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" you ask. \"What do you _think_ is down there?\"\n\n\"Long have I studied this question, seeking knowledge in ancient scrolls and consulting with the wisest of the wise. Not a sausage. All I can say is that in the dead of night when I listen hard at the dungeon door I can sometimes hear a faint scratching noise... like the sound of a million claws far away, scratching and scrabbling at something.

Kensley is delighted to find a bag of seed potatoes at the back, still in good condition.\n\nKensley and you immediately set to work in the small garden at the front of your house, clearing more space for the flowers by pulling up brambles, trimming the grass and making a little vegetable plot, where you plant out the potatoes you found. \n\nFeeling tired you go to your kitchen and make a pot of tea and rummage out some seed cake and a few scones, with pots of strawberry jam and clotted cream. You and Kensley sit on little wooden chairs in the front garden in the sun, and eagerly chomp your way through the delicious food and sip hot tea.\n\nRefreshed you turn to Kensley: \"What do you say to a little ramble?\"\n\nBoth of you stroll along the path among the Hogger-holes in the side of the hill. Most of the students have gone to their lessons but there are a few who have decided to stay behind to weed their gardens or just sit and enjoy the autumn sunshine, and you greet them as you go by. \n\n\"Good morning Brian Banana.\"\n\n\"Pleased to make your acquaintance Rebecca Radishbottom.\"\n\n\"How do you do Betty Appleton?\"\n\nEveryone is friendly and happy to see you even though this is your and Kensley's first day as Hoggers.\n\nYou stroll down to a river at the bottom of the hill and spend a moment watching the sunlight sparkle on the water. Then you notice some flat pebbles on the riverbank and you take turns skimming them across the river. \n\n\"Four bounces Kensley, that's a record!\" you cry in triumph. \n\n\"You liar. That was never four, the last bounce was a sink,\" she says with a smile.\n\n\"It was four bounces, I saw the splashes!\"\n\n\"Oh yeah, well how about this for a splash!\"\n\nWith that Kensley gives you a playful but firm push and you topple backwards into the water. \n\nFor a moment you are submerged, and as you scrabble for something to hold onto, your hand touches something. Something small and hard - you close your fist instinctively. When you come up to the surface you realise you are holding a beautiful shiny golden ring. \n\nAs you climb onto the river bank dripping water Kensley announces that it is her birthday. This is a bit unexpected but, making the best of it, you decide that jewellery usually goes down well as a present, and give her the golden ring.\n\n\"Happy birthday!\" you say. Kensley says nothing in reply and slips the ring into a hidden pocket with a sly look on her face. What odd behaviour! you say to yourself.\n\nThen it's off to the hole to get changed into dry clothes, putting your wet and muddy clothes from the river into the enchanted washing bucket, and reciting the 40 degrees wash incantation.\n\nThen to Kensley's house for dinner where you have a delicious meal in front of a cosy fire.

From the bottom all you can see is that it winds up to some shadowy and little visited part of the school. \n\nAt the top of the stone stairs, you encounter a passageway lined with suits of armour. The empty helmets are turned in your direction and twist to follow you and Snako as you walk past. Even though you know they are just ordinary suits of enchanted magical armour the effect is still rather creepy.\n\nAt the end of the corridor there is a single door which swings open on silent hinges at your touch.\n\nThe room inside is small, dark and bare - but not quite empty.\n\nNext to one wall there is a mirror, with the words above it 'Look at me if you dare, you will see your soul laid bare'.\n\nOpposite, against another wall there's _another_ mirror. Above this one it says 'Stare at me and you will see, what you want to come to be.'\n\nSnako relaxes. \"I know what these are! They're mirrors of desire. They show you what you most want in your whole life, maybe even something you didn't even realise. My mother's got one of those in the downstairs toilet.\"\n\n\"That's amazing!\" you breathe, and step up in front of one of the mirrors nervously.\n\nYou look at your reflection in the mirror and see...\n\n...a taller, more handsome version of yourself. Your chest is pinned with many shiny medals and on your shoulders are an enormous pair of golden tasselled epaullettes. You are wearing an expensive pair of sunglasses and you can just make out a huge crowd of people behind you who seem to be cheering for you. Your reflection grins at you and you are momentarily blinded. Every tooth is capped in pure gold.\n\n\"Wow look at me, I look like some kind of super cool dictator!\"\n\nThen you catch the reflection of the mirror behind you in the mirror in front of you - the reflection of the reflection.\n\nIn _that_ reflection you are quietly reading a book sitting on a comfortable leather chair, calmly stroking a handsome white cat. \n\n\"That's funny,\" you say. \"The reflection of my reflection in the mirror behind me doesn't look so cool at all...\"\n\nThen it dawns on you.\n\nThat gold medal champion version of yourself doesn't _want_ all that power and attention. He's bored of it all - _I_ would be bored of it all. What you are seeing is the dictator version of you's most earnest desire - which is for a quiet life, reading a book, stroking a cat.\n\nYou angle your head to catch more reflections of reflections and see the images of yourself curve away into infinity. \n\nWith each reflection's reflection the cool version of yourself is just that little bit less cool and the quiet version of yourself becomes a little bit less quiet.

The windows look onto vegetable gardens on one side and some overgrown brambles on the other.\n\nYou walk into the class with Kensley and sit down. For this lesson Hedgehog House first years have combined with Snakefang House first years. Snako Malboy - a first year Fanger - sits down on your other side and sneers at you unpleasantly. \n\nProfessor Knid stands at the front patiently while the children settle. His long arms and legs poke out of his wizard's gown. A strange shimmery cloak dangles from his shoulders. Dressed all in black he looks rather like an overgrown spider.\n\nWhen there is silence he raises his hands. His odd looking cloak flutters around him while he speaks:\n\n\"Today you will learn about the care of magical creatures.\n\n\"But before we do that let me take this opportunity to remind you of Slumblebore's warning at the house sorting dinner.\" Professor Knid looks out at the class with a piercing gaze and it appears to you that his eyes are focused directly on you.\n\n\"No-one must go into the dungeons this term. There is something mysterious and very probably dangerous down there this term, and no-one is allowed to interrupt. Is that clear?\"\n\nNods all round from the class.

But not correct, although that last one was a good try. The most common type of magical creature is the insect, or, more generally: the arthropod. Spiders, snails, flies, ants, beetles, woodlice, these are all infinitely more common than the Boggle. And many of them have been enchanted by a magician or witch at some point in the past making them effectively immortal until trodden on. \n\n\"For example, look closely at my cloak children.\" Eric Knid walks up and down the class so the children can see better.\n\nYou realise that the professor's cloak is not merely shimmering, it is _moving_. It seems to be made up of lots of tiny moving _things_. Then you realise what they are and your eyes widen in hideous fascination.\n\nEric Knid's cloak is made up of thousands upon thousands of flies, each fly grasping the flies next to it with their tiny hairy legs. As they flutter their wings or move their black and iridescent green bodies, the cloak appears to undulate as if in a breeze. \n\nTo you and the rest of the class it seems revolting, but Professor Knid is oblivious.\n\n\"Until you look closely my cloak is just an ordinary magician's cape. But it is actually made up of thousands of enchanted and specially trained flies. And each one can fly off at my command to do my bidding - to deliver a message perhaps, or sit on someone's dinner and do a little poo, or - distract a powerful wizard in the act of casting a spell.\n\n\"Yes the insect world is a vast and overlooked wonder and in this lesson I am going to teach you about a tiny portion of it.\n\n\"But before we learn any magic, does anyone doubt me that the arthropods - the insects - are the true marvels of the animal world?\"\n\nProfessor Knid looks round expectantly, his eyebrows raised.","choice_1_link":["recneyU0x7csPEiuL"],"status":"Done","choice_2_link":["recT1tUcrM0Zzs3nI"],"choice_1_text":"You don't like insects that much.

From the bottom all you can see is that it winds up to some shadowy and little visited part of the school. \n\nAt the top of the stone stairs, you encounter a passageway lined with suits of armour. The empty helmets are turned in your direction and twist to follow you and Kensley as you walk past. Even though you know they are just ordinary suits of enchanted magical armour you can't help a little gibber of fear.\n\nAt the end of the corridor there is a single door which swings open on silent hinges at your touch.\n\nThe room inside is small, dark and bare - but not quite empty.\n\nNext to one wall there is a mirror, with the words above it 'Look at me if you dare, you will see your soul laid bare'.\n\nOpposite, against another wall there's _another_ mirror. Above this one it says 'Stare at me and you will see, what you want to come to be.'\n\nKensley relaxes. \"I know what these are! They're mirrors of desire. They show you what you most want in your whole life, maybe even something you didn't even realise. My granny's got one in the bathroom.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure I want to look...\" you say, but your curiosity compels you to step up in front of one of the mirrors.\n\nYou look at your reflection in the mirror and see...\n\n...a beaming, chubbier and slightly older version of yourself. You are wearing a lovely pair of green wellington boots and a fetching brown tweed waistcoat. In one hand you hold a bunch of the largest carrots you have ever seen and in the other a trophy on which you can just make out the words 'Gardener of the Year'.\n\n\"Kensley look, I'm chief gardener. And look at the size of those carrots!\"\n\nThen you catch the reflection of the mirror behind you in the mirror in front of you - the reflection of the reflection.\n\nIn _that_ reflection you are calmly sitting at a table, wearing worn out clothes, and pushing seeds one at a time into little pots filled with compost. \n\n\"That's funny,\" you say. \"The reflection of my reflection in the mirror behind me doesn't look like an award winning gardener at all...\"\n\nThen it dawns on you.\n\nThat Gardner of the Year version of yourself doesn't _want_ all that fame and attention. He's tired of it - _I_ would be tired of it. What you are seeing is the top gardener version of you's most earnest desire - which is for a quiet life, doing what he really loves: growing vegetables.\n\nYou angle your head to catch more reflections of reflections and see the images of yourself curve away into infinity. \n\nWith each reflection's reflection the chief gardener version of yourself is just that little bit less successful, with slightly shorter carrots, and the quiet version of yourself becomes a little bit less shabby. Far into the depths of the mirrors you can just make out an Arthur just like yourself, waving back at you.\n\nYou shake your head, confused, and tell Kensley what you saw.\n\n\"That's it!\" she says. \"That must be it!

No way are you going to let these disgusting insects take over - you are going to fight back and destroy them, starting with Azog!\n\nAzog is too nimble to be caught so easily though and leaps out of the way.\n\n\"You will regret your choice Arthur,\" screams the spider king in outrage. \"Insects, attack!\"\n\nFrom out of cracks in the walls, ceiling and floor crawl millions upon millions of arthropods: beetles, woodlice, ants, millipedes, earwigs, spiders in a great stream heading straight for you.\n\nThis time you don't hesitate. If you stay you will be surrounded and overwhelmed. You turn and run. \n\nYour heart pounding, you run back out of the dungeon up towards the school. You have a plan.\n\nWhen you reach the enchanted door that leads down into the dungeon you dash through and slam it shut. You can hear the enchanted locking mechanism clicking shut.\n\nThere's only one way for the insects to get past the door now - through the keyhole. You turn and wait, your wand at the ready.\n\nAs soon as you see the first hairy little leg poking out of the keyhole you use your wand as a flamethrower shouting \"fiel fresa fusila fuego\" again and again until your voice is hoarse.\n\nThe air is full of the harsh high pitched cries of dying arthropods and the sizzle of roasting chitin. But still the insects come, propelled onwards by the Great Azog's iron will.\n\nYou are getting tired now, your arm is sore from being held up so long and you can feel your reserves of magical energy running out. You cannot hold out much longer.\n\nFor a moment the magical fire from your wand flickers and dies.\n\nThen three things happen simultaneously: \n\nOne: Azog, sensing his chance, launches himself through the keyhole aiming straight for your face. \n\nTwo: Snako and Slumblebore run round the corner to see you battling the numberless insect foe on your own.\n\nThree: your faltering spell was a trick. You have enough magical power for one last spell...\n\n\"Fiel fresa fusila fuego!\" you scream pointing your wand at Azog as he flies through the air towards you.\n\nThen...\n\nAzog, leaping through the air fangs at the ready, is unable to change direction. Just as your wand arm comes _up_ he reaches the tip of the wand, only to be blasted backwards by a concentrated jet of magical fire. Even the great Azog cannot withstand an attack at such close range. He hits the wall next to the dungeon door, his legs still on fire and body a smoking ruin.\n\nThe last words of Azog the Great are \"Arthur... you have roasted me...\". Then a final puff and Azog is no more.\n\nWith Azog a gonner the rest of the arthropod hordes lose all cohesion. When Slumblebore cautiously opens the door to the dungeon they are fleeing in all directions, and will trouble the school no more. Slumblebore lets off a few more blasts of fire to encourage them on their way.\n\n\"You did it Arthur!\" cries Snako. \"You saved the school - the evil has gone!\"\n\nYou stand still and listen carefully. Snako is right. You cannot sense the insects any longer. The dungeons have been cleansed.\n\n\"Well done indeed Arthur,\" and Slumblebore, turning back to you. \"I had a feeling that you were the special one. Without you I fear we would have been overrun by insects by now.\"\n\n\"It was Eric Knid,\" you say to Slumblebore. \"It was Professor Knid who summoned the insect army, with Azog the spider king. He is down in the dungeon now unconscious. Azog bit him.\"\n\n\"Eric did you say? Well I'm not surprised. He always struck me as a bit of an odd fish. Nevermind we will pick him up in the morning and I shall give him an official reprimand. And if he does it again I will have no choice but to put him on a performance improvement plan.\"\n\n\"But you Arthur, what else can I give _you_ but my most heartfelt thanks.\" You can't suppress a broad grin. You did it! You defeated Azog and his insect army single handed!\n\nSlumbelbore continues: \"You truly are a hero Arthur, a hero of Hogsnorts School.\"","choice_1_link":["rec1urOdjUo8YEY4T"],"status":"Done","choice_1_text":"The next day...","title":"School hero","section":"section2-snake","emoji":"üéì","interface_link":"https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/pagP1bZI9Mlm1p0Vk?khoME=recbL8sFqHL7W08TF","interface_link_choice_1":["https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/pagP1bZI9Mlm1p0Vk?khoME=rec1urOdjUo8YEY4T"],"choice_1_btn":{"label":"option 1","url":"https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/pagP1bZI9Mlm1p0Vk?khoME=rec1urOdjUo8YEY4T"},"choice_2_btn":{"label":"option 2","url":""},"choice_3_btn":{"label":"option 3","url":""},"choice_4_btn":{"label":"option 4","url":""},"hyperlink_final":"choose-hero-s","choice_5_btn":{"label":"option 5","url":""},"autonumber":247,"chrono_num":121,"story_numbers":["rec5B79LHXFJsmRpM"],"choice_1_storynum":[148],"choice_1_goto":"Go to number 148","story_num":[296],"record_link":"https://airtable.com/appwHHPuLPYFSpBwv/tblY5DZkA8Y5UlgXt/viwInIHzWhN93PDbS/recbL8sFqHL7W08TF"},{"id":"recu7sK3KaJwJFifc","content":"Along with most of the other children you keep your hands down.\n\n\"You don't want to hear my jokes?
