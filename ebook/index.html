    <h1>How to read this book</h1>
<p>This is a story where <strong>you</strong> have to choose how your adventure unfolds.</p>
<p>Each chapter has a number and when you have finished the chapter you will have a list of options. Each option shows the number of a chapter you can choose to go to next.</p>
<p>Sometimes there will be lots of options. Sometimes just one.</p>
<p>The options at end of the chapter are not links - you can't click them and go to that chapter.</p>
<p>Instead you have to bring up the list of chapters on your reading device and scroll to the one you need.</p>
<p>Why did I do it this way?</p>
<p>Well for some of the options you need to <em>figure out</em> the number of the chapter. If it was a link you could just click and go without figuring out anything - much less fun!</p>
<p>But also because scrolling through the chapters brings the feel and excitement of turning the pages in a 'real' &quot;choose how your adventure unfolds&quot; book to find the next part of the story. Who knows where you will end up next?</p>
<h1>The story begins...</h1>
<h2 class="text-centre" id="1">1. <br>
The mysterious letter</h2>
<p>"Arthur come here quick!" says Evan to you. "You've got a funny letter!"
</p><p>You yawn and get up from the breakfast table. You can see your little brother Evan holding a large old fashioned looking envelope that has just been posted through the front door.</p>
<p>&quot;Lemme see&quot; you say.</p>
<p>Sure enough on the front of the yellow-brown envelope is your name, Arthur Otley, written in spidery black ink. How curious. You turn the letter over and are surprised to see a big blob of red wax holding the envelope closed, not the normal spit-glue.</p>
<p>You don't get many letters and you have <em>never</em> got a letter that looked like this before. It looks like it was posted 100 years ago.</p>
<p>&quot;Morning my little munchkins!&quot; Dad cries out as he bounds down the stairs in his dressing gown. &quot;What's that you've got there Arthur?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's a letter, but... it looks a bit odd&quot; you reply.</p>
<p>&quot;Junk mail eh?&quot; says Dad.</p>
<p>Will you:</p><p></p>
<p class="text-centre">............................................................</p>
<div class="text-choice">
<p>1. Examine the envelope more carefully, perhaps it will reveal some clues about who sent it. ~ <strong>Go to number 50</strong></p>
<p>2. Rip open the envelope immediately and see what's inside. ~ <strong>Go to number 9</strong></p>
</div>
<h2 class="text-centre" id="2">2. <br>
 Snako Malboy</h2>
<p>"Hello," you say to the boy "my name's Arthur Otley and I'm going to Hogsnorts. Who are you?"
</p><p>The boy does his sneering smile at you again.</p>
<p>&quot;Snako Malboy. Yes I too am going to Hogsnorts. My father went to Hogsnorts. My grandfather went to Hogsnorts. So did his father and so on up to 72 generations and the founding of the school. Sylvester Snake - yes <em>the</em> Sylvester Snake is my direct ancestor. And my mother and their mothers too. So yes I am going to Hogsnorts.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who is Sylvester Snake?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sylvester Snake is only the founder of Snake House! The best house in the school. I'm going to be in Snake House. Snake House is for the really powerful wizards, like I will be one day. You will be in Hedgehog House I suppose.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I haven't decided yet&quot; you reply.</p>
<p>&quot;Well if you want to be Snake House like me you have to be strong and ruthless. Snake House rules yah sssssssss!&quot;</p>
<p>Snako Malboy stuck his tongue in and out of his mouth like a snake and hissed - not an easy thing to do at the same time. You are impressed.</p>
<p>At that point the magic tape measure is finished with Snako and moves over to you.</p><p></p>

<p>You will have to try something else.</p><p></p>

A spellbook puzzle</h2>
<p>You walk further into the book shop and spy a cheerful looking old witch wearing a black t-shirt with the word Watertomes on the back.
</p><p>&quot;Excuse me,&quot; you say &quot;Can you show me where the year 1 spellbook is?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Off to Hogsnorts are you young man?&quot; replies the old witch with a little cackle. &quot;Yes I can show you, follow me!&quot;</p>
<p>You and your mum follow the Watertomes witch as she shuffles off to the back of the bookshop. She picks up a heavy red book.</p>
<p>&quot;That will be 14 Frigates please.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah yes,&quot; replies your mum, &quot;We've only got pounds. Is that a problem?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well to tell the truth I don't really need money because I can magic up anything I like anyway. But I can't just give it to you for nothing... Tell you what, if you can solve my puzzle you can have it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What's the puzzle?&quot; you reply nervously, you never did like puzzles that much.</p>
<p>&quot;My lovely spell books are all about turning words into magic. And one of the magic things about words is that you can turn them into numbers.</p>
<p>For example the word CAB can turn into the number 6. C is the third letter of the alphabet, A is the first letter and B is the second. 3 + 1 + 2 = 6 so CAB turns into 6.</p>
<p>If you can magically turn my name into a number I will give you this book. My name is BOB. The old witch called Bob smiles at you encouragingly.</p>
<p>&quot;Hmmm let's see&quot; you say. As you are thinking the boy you saw at the front of the bookshop pushes a piece of paper into your hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Here!&quot; he says, &quot;this should help!&quot;</p>
<p>The piece of paper has all the letters of the alphabet next to their numbers:</p>
<p>A=1, B=2, C=3, E=4, D=5, F=6, G=7, H=8, I=9, J=10, K=11, L=12, M=13, N=14, O=15, P=16, Q=17, R=18, S=19, T=20, U=21, V=22, W=23, X=24, Y=25, Z=26</p><p></p>
<p class="text-centre">............................................................</p>
<div class="text-choice">
<p>1. You turn Bob's name into a number, and go to that number ~ <strong>Go to the number of your answer</strong></p>
<p>2. You don't fancy maths right now - you go to get your magic wand ~ <strong>Go to number 5</strong></p>
</div>
<h2 class="text-centre" id="5">5. <br>
Wanderful Wands</h2>
<p>You decide to visit Wally's Wanderful Wands shop next. Now that you are looking good in your pointy wizard hat, you want to get your hands on a wand as soon as possible and start doing some real magic!
</p><p>The sign above Wally's shop is a giant wand dangling from a chain above the shop door. It swings gently to and fro even though there is no breeze to speak of, and little crackles of electric-gold magic arc over its surface.</p>
<p>You can't help thinking that this wand must also double up as Wally's security system.</p>
<p>With a nervous glance upwards you and your Mum enter the shop.</p>
<p>The inside is sparklingly clean and glass cabinets are artfully arranged around the shop. Each cabinet contains three or four magic wands, resting on little red cushions with gold tassles. It all looks <em>very</em> expensive.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur are you sure this is the only wand shop?&quot; asks your mum. &quot;Perhaps there is another one that is not quite so err... so un...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Welcome!&quot; a smooth rich voice startles them from the back of the room. &quot;Welcome to Wally's Wanderful Wand shop! And madam I can assure you that this is the only wand shop in Hippoto Mews. But fear not I'm sure we can find a wand that is the perfect match for young Arthur.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How did you know my name?&quot; you ask in surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the many branches of magic in which I am an expert, young Arthur, is mind reading. Just by looking into your eyes I can see the entire contents of your brain. I can also do it by looking in your ears, in your mouth, up your nose... any hole works to tell the truth. But I usually prefer the eyes. Also your Mum called you Arthur when you entered my shop.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you are Wally I suppose?&quot; says your Mum.</p>
<p>&quot;I am indeed, dear madam. Did you divine this from looking in my ear hole? Remarkable!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No I figured it out when you said this was your shop.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Quite so. We are all mind-readers to some degree.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Wally&quot; you interrupt &quot;can I have a wand please?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No you cannot have <em>a</em> wand Arthur. But what you can have is <em>the</em> wand. Every wand is unique! You are unique! You require the exact match for your particular thaumaturgical resonance. Your thaumaturgic twin as it were. The most powerful - the only! - tool you will ever need as a magician.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That sounds nice,&quot; says your Mum, &quot;but we don't want anything <em>too</em> fancy. The thing is we don't have much, or in fact any, wizard money. Frigates I mean.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The wand is of course priceless. I do offer a 10% discount for Hogsnorts' students in their first year. But for you I will increase this discount to 100% if - if! - Arthur and I can establish a true connection of minds, and I can see that you Arthur are a worthy wandholder.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A 100% discount you say? That's a good deal. Arthur see if you can connect up your mind with Wally's love.&quot; your Mum suggests.</p>
<p>Wally crouches down in front of you and holds your ears gently but firmly forcing you to look deep into his blue grey eyes. At first nothing happens. But after just a few moments you get the strange sensation of being <em>pulled</em>  towards his eyeballs; his black pupils feel like they are <em>dragging</em> you inwards.</p>
<p>&quot;Good Arthur, very good!&quot; says Wally. &quot;I believe that the magical connection between our minds is now established, and astonishingly quickly too! You must have deep reserves of magic.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur I need you to think of a number. If I can read your mind and tell you the number you were thinking of this will be proof that the magical mind connection is working properly.</p>
<p>&quot;First I need you to think of a number between 1 and 10. But don't tell me what it is! Have you got one?&quot;</p>
<p>You think of a number and nod your head.</p>
<p>&quot;Now&quot; says Wally, &quot;I need you to multiply this number by 9. 9 is a number with strong magical properties&quot; he explains.</p>
<p>You multiply your number by 9.</p>
<p>&quot;The next step&quot; he says, &quot;is to split your answer into the two digits and add those two digits together. For example if your answer is 13 (and I know it is not!) then you would split it into 1 and 3, then add that 1 and 3 together, so 1 + 3 = 4.</p>
<p>&quot;Ok&quot; you say as you do the sum in your head.</p>
<p>&quot;Now take that answer and multiply it by 6. Can you do that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes&quot; you reply.</p>
<p>&quot;Now turn to that number! And we will see if our minds are connected.&quot;</p><p></p>
<p class="text-centre">............................................................</p>
<div class="text-choice">
<p>1. Turn to the number that you have thought of ~ <strong>Go to the number of your answer</strong></p>
<p>2. You are not in the mood for mindreading, go to get your spell book instead ~ <strong>Go to number 26</strong></p>

Back on the street</h2>
<p>Back on Hippoto Mews, the crowds of witches and wizards seem even thicker.
</p><p>When a small child magician walks past because the pointy end of their hat is about the same height as your face and when one of them turns round quickly, it could easily poke your eye out if you are not careful.</p>
<p>But this doesn't really bother you, it's so exciting to be around real magicians!</p>
<p>&quot;Do you feel better after some fresh air Arthur?&quot; asks your mum. &quot;We still need to get your wizard robes before you can go to Hogsnorts. Come on, let's go back to see those witches&quot;</p><p></p>

Pigeon holed</h2>
<p>You elbow your way to the front of the queue. You can't wait to see what will happen next! 
</p><p>&quot;Arthur Otley&quot; says Slumblebore, &quot;as you are first in line, please go down into the hole.&quot;</p>
<p>You feel very excited and a bit nervous. What amazing things could be down there? Will you have to do a test to get into a House? Fight a monster perhaps? Fight this mysterious singing Percy?</p>
<p>You carefully go down the steps into the darkness. You descend until all you can see above you is a circle of light and the noise of the hall fades to nothing.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello? Percy?&quot;</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>Then: &quot;Coo coo come closer, so I can see you better!&quot;</p>
<p>The voice emerging from the blackness in front of you has a strange high pitched musical quality to it. Fear closes your throat and you are rooted to the spot. Then... ouch! Something has bitten you on the bum! You see a small spider dropping off your robes and scurrying away into the darkness.</p>
<p>The pain in your bum gets you moving. You slowly walk forwards.</p>
<p>As you get closer you can just make out two round yellow eyes staring back at you, and between them a large... beak? Is Percy some kind of monster? It doesn't look or sound dangerous...</p>
<p>Your eyes adjust to the dark and you realise that you are staring at a gigantic pigeon, that's as tall as you are, even sitting down.</p>
<p>&quot;Who are you?&quot; you ask.</p>
<p>&quot;Coo coo I'm Percy the Picking Pigeon and I will choose your house for you coo coo! Look into my eyes Arthur, look into my eyes...&quot;</p>
<p>You stare into the yellow eyes of the pigeon which seem to grow until they become the entire world.</p>
<p>&quot;Coo coo, well, you are brave Arthur to come here first,&quot; says Percy. &quot;Ambitious perhaps, and clever too. You could be a Lionpaw fighting for the truth. Or a Snakefang rising to the top. Or a Ravenwing mastering the secrets of the universe. But certainly not a cowardly Hedgehog House. Coo coo.&quot;</p>
<p>As Percy the Picking Pigeon probes your mind, you concentrate with all your being, repeating to yourself:</p><p></p>
<p class="text-centre">............................................................</p>
<div class="text-choice">
<p>1. Lionpaw Lionpaw, please let it be Lionpaw! ~ <strong>Go to number 15</strong></p>

<p>3. Snakefang, Snakefang is where I belong! ~ <strong>Go to number 192</strong></p>

Crash landing at Hogsnorts</h2>
<p>"Hey, I'm bored, just sitting here" Robert says suddenly. "I'm going to fly this car myself."
</p><p>&quot;Are you sure that's a good idea?&quot; you say. &quot;Your Dad enchanted the car to fly all the way to Hogsnorts. I mean, do you know the way?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How hard can it be?&quot; says Robert, getting out his wand. &quot;We just follow the train. <em>Autopilotus stoppus!</em>&quot;</p>
<p>With that, the car gave a little cough and a splutter, went silent, and gently started a death dive to the ground far below.</p>
<p>&quot;Aaaargh Robert, what have you done?!&quot; yells Aaron. &quot;Turn it back on!!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hmmm which one is the 'engine on' button?&quot; muses Robert as the car bursts downwards through the clouds, the shrieking wind all around them.</p>
<p>You are dry mouthed with fear, trying desperately not to scream as Robert calmly tries the different buttons on the car dashboard.</p>
<p>&quot;Not this one... no... not that one either... Aha! There we go!&quot; the car engine starts again, and the vehicle begins to spiral crazily as Robert pulls hard on the steering wheel to bring it back under control.</p>
<p>Just then you see something so amazing it makes you forget even your impending splatter on the ground below.</p>
<p>A mile or two away a colossal stone building stands at the top of a grassy hill. Towers sprout from the building like mushrooms, spiralling outwards at crazy angles. The roofs are studded with battlements. The walls are encrusted with beautiful stained glass windows. And over it all hangs a faint golden glow of pure magic. Hogsnorts School of Magic.</p>
<p>&quot;Watch out Robert, flying monkeys below!&quot; shouts out Alex.</p>
<p>You tear your eyes away from the building. Unbelievably Alex is right: a flock of flying monkeys is directly in your path. It is hard to make out but the flying monkeys appear to be carrying people...</p>
<p>The monkeys scatter in all directions as the car zooms through the middle of them, and you just have time to make out that each pair of flying monkeys is carrying a young witch or wizard. You realise that for some insane reason the flying monkeys are transporting the children to the school.</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry!&quot; shouts Robert out of the window at the monkeys, still wrestling with the steering wheel.</p>
<p>He just manages to bring it under control in time to make a very bumpy landing on the Hogsnorts school lawn.</p>
<p>You lean back in the car, your breath coming in short panicky bursts. You can't quite believe that you are still alive. Robert, Alex and Aaron seem amazingly unaffected by their near fatal driving experiment.</p>
<p>&quot;Ok boys, let's get out of here before the Profs catch us!&quot; shouts Robert.</p>
<p>All of you tumble out of the car, grab your stuff and make a run for the nearest entrance to Hogsnorts, your rubbery legs just about managing to propel you along.</p>
<p>You dash into the school and follow Robert, Alex and Aaron into the school hall to sit down with the other children. Sitting down at a wooden bench on the table reserved for first year students, you feel you are a long way from Leeds railway station.</p><p></p>

The invitation</h2>
<p>You rip open the envelope and pull out an ancient looking piece of parchment.
</p><p>At the top it says <strong>Hogsnorts School of Magic</strong>.</p>
<p>A school of magic? you think. What the...? Maybe this <em>is</em> junk mail after all. You carry on reading...</p>
<p>.........................................</p>
<div class="text-poem">
<p><em>Dear Arthur,</em></p>
<p><em>I am delighted to inform you that you have been selected to attend Hogsnorts School of Magic. You have hidden but powerful magical abilities :-)</em></p>
<p><em>As a new student you will need to bring the following items on your first day:</em></p>
<p><em>- a magic wand</em><br>
<em>- a wizard's robe and hat</em><br>
<em>- a year-1 spellbook</em></p>
<p><em>They can be purchased from the magical shops located on the magical street Hippoto Mews, London, just behind Gutter Lane.</em></p>
<p><em>Term will start on 1 September. Please come to Leeds Railway Station, from where the Hogsnorts Express will depart at 9.34 precisely.</em></p>
<p><em>Yours resplendently,<br>
Zebediah Slumblebore<br>
Headmaster<br>
Hogsnorts School</em></p>
<p><em>P.S. Remember the secret code to enter Hippoto Mews is: TAP TAP TAP... TAP.</em></p>
<p><em>P.P.S. Note that due to the alarming recent magical disturbances at the school, the parents of all pupils are required to sign a &quot;child's demise liability waiver&quot; before arriving at Hogsnorts.</em></p>
</div>
<p>.........................................</p>
<p>You feel your blood prickle to the surface of your skin. Can this be real? Do you really have hidden powerful magic abilities? Maybe this is some big mistake? Or worse - a joke.</p>
<p>But then... there have been times where <em>strange things</em> have occurred without you knowing why.</p>
<p>Like that time you fell out of the apple tree in your cousin's house, but instead of falling down you <em>floated</em> down like a leaf, and gently landed on the ground.</p>
<p>Or that time you played hide and seek and wished that you could make yourself invisible and <em>no-one could find you</em> even though you were just hiding under the kitchen table and it should have been easy.</p>
<p>And the fact that every now and again you have a conversation with a spider and you can <em>understand what they are saying</em>.</p>
<p>A slow smile spreads across your face. It <em>must be true!</em></p>
<p>You are going to magic school.</p><p></p>

A new friend?</h2>
<p>It will be good to get to know someone you might be going to school with, perhaps he can tell you what it's like.
</p><p>&quot;Hello&quot; you say to the boy. &quot;I'm Arthur. Are you going to Hogsnorts?&quot;</p>
<p>The boy looks up at you. &quot;Yep I'm going to Hogsnorts. Did you know that they have the biggest magical library in the country?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No...&quot; you say. You wonder how many other magical libraries there are in the country.</p>
<p>&quot;Anyway I'm Daniel Colliers-Wood. And this is my little brother Robin Colliers-Wood.&quot;</p>
<p>You notice another boy sitting just round the next bookshelf from Daniel, reading a comic book about a policeman with the body of a man and the head of a dog.</p>
<p>&quot;Daniel,&quot; you ask &quot;Do you know much about Hogsnorts? What it's like when you get there I mean?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I've read all about it. Well the main thing to know is that there are four &quot;houses&quot; or teams you could call them. The best house is Ravenwing house, that's where I want to go, Ravenwing House has that big library I told you about. The Ravenwings love studying. The other houses are Lion House for the brave, Snakefang House for the powerful, and Hedgehog House for the prickly. You will probably be in Hedgehog House.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No I won't!&quot; you protest automatically.</p>
<p>&quot;Alright Mr Prickles,&quot; says Daniel. &quot;I was just trying to wind you up. Anyway no one really knows which house they will be in until they get to Hogsnorts.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I want to go to Snakefang house, that would be so cool!&quot; pipes up Daniel's younger brother Robin.</p>
<p>&quot;Listen young man - Daniel was it?&quot; your mum interrupts &quot;I'm sure Arthur will be in Lion House, he is a very brave boy. Do you remember Arthur when you got stung by a wasp and you didn't even cry?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mu-um!&quot; you complain. Turning back to Daniel: &quot;Anyway Daniel, see you around.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bye bye Arthur&quot; says Daniel picking up his book.</p><p></p>

 Snako Malboy </h2>
<p>"Hello," you say to the boy "my name's Arthur Otley and I'm going to Hogsnorts. Who are you?"
</p><p>The boy does his sneering smile at you again.</p>
<p>&quot;Snako Malboy. Yes I too am going to Hogsnorts. My father went to Hogsnorts. My grandfather went to Hogsnorts. So did his father and so on up to 72 generations and the founding of the school. Sylvester Snake - yes <em>the</em> Sylvester Snake is my direct ancestor. And my mother and their mothers too. So yes I am going to Hogsnorts.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who is Sylvester Snake?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sylvester Snake is only the founder of Snake House, duh! The best house in the school. I'm going to be in Snake House. Snake House is for the really powerful wizards, like I will be one day. You will be in Hedgehog House I suppose.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I haven't decided yet&quot; you reply.</p>
<p>&quot;Well if you want to be Snake House like me you have to be strong and ruthless. Snake House rules yah sssssssss!&quot;</p>
<p>Snako Malboy stuck his tongue in and out of his mouth like a snake and hissed - not an easy thing to do at the same time. You are impressed.</p>
<p>At that point the magic tape measure is finished with Snako and moves over to you.</p><p></p>

Arriving in Hognsorts</h2>
<p>"Yaaargh!" you exclaim as the ground drops away beneath you. You have never travelled by flying monkey before and it's an unnerving experience, not helped by the fact that the monkeys are screeching and chattering constantly. They seem to be having an excellent time.
</p><p>But then something else makes you forget about the ever growing drop to the ground, about the grasping fingers of the winged monkey on either side: Hogsnorts.</p>
<p>A mile or two away you see a colossal stone building at the top of a grassy hill. Towers sprout from the building like mushrooms, spiralling outwards at crazy angles. The roofs are studded with battlements. The walls are encrusted with beautiful stained glass windows. And over it all hangs a faint golden glow of pure magic. Hogsnorts School of Magic.</p>
<p>But you have no time to take in the view. A loud car horn honk comes from the clouds <em>above</em> you. You twist your head up to see...</p>
<p>...a dark blue ford fiesta corkscrewing through the sky, heading straight for the troupe of winged monkeys! A flying car - amazing! you think, momentarily forgetting you are about to be flown over.</p>
<p>Luckily nothing is more agile than a flying monkey and the primates pirouette away from the barely controlled flying vehicle as it zooms through the middle of them. From the window of the car you hear a faint cry of &quot;sorry!&quot; as the monkeys chatter with rage.</p>
<p>The car hurtles off towards Hogsnorts and you can just make out a bumpy but survivable crash landing and three small figures running out of the car towards the school. The car turns round and flies off through the sky.</p>
<p>The rest of the flight is comparatively uneventful.</p>
<p>The monkeys soar in through an open window of the Hogsnorts Great Hall and gently set you down on a wooden bench at a table reserved for first year students. You feel you are a long way from Leeds railway station.</p><p></p>

House picking</h2>
<p>You get to your feet slowly and then pretend to tie your shoe lace as the other first years get in line. Then you join the back of the queue. By watching what happens to someone else, you can plan your next move.
</p><p>&quot;Aaron Bleezeley,&quot; says Slumblebore at last, &quot;please go down into the hole.&quot;</p>
<p>Aaron looks very nervous as he slowly walks forward towards the hole, his red hair peeking out from under his wizard hat.</p>
<p>Better him than me you think.</p>
<p>He goes down the wooden steps into the darkness, and then there is silence. All the students are holding their breath, waiting to see when - if! - Aaron will emerge again. You are so nervous you can feel sweat trickle down your back.</p>
<p>Then, after what seems like an age, you see Aaron's pointy hat, then head, then body come up out of the hole. He's ok! you are relieved to see, although he looks a bit dazed.</p>
<p>In his hands, for some unknown reason, he is holding a large, beautiful, red and gold striped egg. The colours of Lionpaw House!</p>
<p>Professor Slumblebore sees the egg and shouts out to the hall: &quot;Aaron Bleezeley, Lionpaw House!&quot;</p>
<p>A great cheer comes from the Lionpaw table, and Aaron walks over to them, a huge grin on his face. Two other red heads, his brothers Robert and Alex, clap him on the back.</p>
<p>After Aaron the other children slowly go down... and then return, each with an egg in the colours of their house.</p>
<p>&quot;Snako Malboy, Snakefang House!&quot; shouts Slumblebore as Snako emerges with a green and silver egg.</p>
<p>&quot;Daniel Colliers-Wood, Ravenwing House!&quot; Daniel carefully holds his blue and copper coloured egg as he happily walks over to the Ravenwing table.</p>
<p>&quot;Kensley Potato, Hedgehog House!&quot; Kensley clutches a nondescript brown egg and shuffles over to the other Hoggers.</p>
<p>Now finally there is only you left.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur Otley&quot; says Slumblebore looking at you with a twinkle in his eye that you don't trust one bit, &quot;please go down the hole.&quot;</p><p></p>

The Bleezeleys</h2>
<p>You walk over to the family of red haired wizards on the other side of the station.
</p><p>&quot;Excuse me&quot; you ask, &quot;are you wizards?&quot;</p>
<p>The children look a bit shifty and say nothing, while the Dad answers for them: &quot;Wizards? No we're err... on our way to a fancy dress party. Why do you want to know anyway?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm trying to find the train to Hogsnorts but I don't know where it is, and it is almost time for the train to leave!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah I see,&quot; says the mum, &quot;that's the train we want too. Yes we are wizards but we try to keep it quiet, you know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mum!&quot; interrupts one of the red haired children, &quot;now we are definitely going to miss the train!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We're going to miss the train?&quot; you ask. &quot;Does that mean that we can't get to Hogsnorts now?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't worry young man&quot; says the Dad. &quot;Where there's a wizard there's a way, eh? But first we should introduce ourselves. We are the Bleezeley family:</p>
<p>&quot;This is Aaron, who is going to Hogsnorts for the first time this year.&quot; (The shortest red haired boy gives you a small wave.)</p>
<p>&quot;These two are Alex and Robert. They are in year 4&quot; (Alex and Robert nod their heads at you.)</p>
<p>&quot;I'm Mr Bleezeley and this is Mrs Bleezeley.&quot; (Mrs Bleezeley gives you a cheery thumbs up.)</p>
<p>&quot;Hello everyone,&quot; you say. &quot;My name is Arthur Otley and I just discovered I was a wizard a few days ago. I'm a first year. This is my dad and my younger brother Evan&quot; (Your dad and Evan have just walked up.)</p>
<p>&quot;Of course you're a wizard Arthur,&quot; said the mum, &quot;You've got red hair like us! Most people with red hair have at least a bit of magic in them and I can see that you've got more than most!&quot;</p>
<p>You are pleased to hear Mrs Bleezeley say this, but still feel worried about the train.</p>
<p>&quot;But M Bleezeley, Mrs Bleezeley, what about the train? How are we going to get to Hogsnorts?&quot; you ask.</p>

<p>Lionpaw, Lionpaw please let it be Lionpaw! you say to yourself over and over again.
</p><p>Coo coo are you sure it's Lionpaw? asks Percy the pigeon, speaking directly into your mind now.</p>
<p>Yes yes, I'm sure. Not a Snakefang bully, not a brainbox Ravenwing, not a boring old Hedgehog. Lionpaw please, please!</p>
<p>Coo coo as you wish young Arthur, speaks Percy into your brain.</p>
<p>Slowly the great yellow eyes shrink to normal size and you are just staring at a regular giant talking pigeon again.</p>
<p>Percy waddles over to the centre of the hole where the light from the hall shines down. He looks old and you wonder how long he has been doing this. For decades, centuries even?</p>
<p>He settles down on the floor, coos once or twice and then waddles back into the darkness at the edge of the hole that is his home, leaving right in the centre a beautiful egg.</p>
<p>The egg is covered in red and gold stripes. The colours of Lionpaw House!</p>
<p>Your heart pounding with excitement you pick up the egg and slowly walk back up the wooden stairs to the noise and light of the Hogsnorts Great Hall.</p>

<p>Back on Hippoto Mews, the crowds of witches and wizards seem even thicker.
</p><p>When a small child magician walks past because the pointy end of their hat is about the same height as your face and when one of them turns round quickly, it could easily poke your eye out if you are not careful.</p>
<p>But this doesn't really bother you, it's so exciting to be around real magicians!</p>

<p>Now you have your robes and your wand it will be nice to have some spells to cast, you decide and head towards Watertomes bookshop, your mum following behind you.

<p>&quot;...his own fault he never should have summoned that demon...&quot;</p>
<p>Watertomes is a small shop with an old wooden door and cramped dusty windows. You push the door open with a creak and enter hesitantly.</p>
<p>The inside is enormous: by some magic it is many times bigger than the outside. Brightly lit bookshelves stretch away from you to the left and right.</p>

The letters keep coming</h2>
<p>"Give me my letter!" you shout, as you leap towards your Dad, arms outstretched.
</p><p>You just catch a glimpse of your Dad's look of surprise, before tripping on some of Evan's lego and landing flat on your back.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you alright Arthur?&quot; asks your Dad.</p>
<p>&quot;Hnngh. Fine.&quot; you reply looking up at him from the floor.</p>
<p>&quot;Good!&quot; says Dad, tearing up the letter into tiny shreds as he talks. &quot;Now let's put this junk mail in the bin. You know you really shouldn't get so worked up about it, I cleaned out our gutters just last month.&quot;</p>
<p>You close your eyes. Next time you will need to do better. But will there be a next time?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The next morning, just as the night is turning into day, you tiptoe carefully down the stairs before anyone else is awake. You position yourself at the front door, open the letter box and peep outside. No sign of the postman just yet.</p>
<p>You settle down to wait.</p>
<p>After 30 minutes... still no postman.</p>
<p>After 1 hour... no postman.</p>
<p>After 1 hour and 10 minutes... Dad walks downstairs.</p>
<p>&quot;What are you doing down there Arthur?&quot; he asks.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing, you reply,&quot; standing up quickly. &quot;I was just err... was just..&quot;</p>
<p>Just then there is a gentle thud behind you as the now familiar letter falls to the floor.</p>

Pigeon holed</h2>
<p>With a lump of fear in your throat you slowly walk down the wooden steps that take you deep down into the dark hole.
</p><p>What will you find down there? Everyone else emerged unscathed so it can't be dangerous can it? But will it be painful? What is this strange singing Percy creature?</p>
<p>You descend until all you can see above you is a circle of light and the noise of the hall fades to nothing.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello? Percy?&quot;</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>Then: &quot;Coo coo come closer, so I can see you better!&quot;</p>
<p>The voice emerging from the blackness in front of you has a strange high pitched musical quality to it. Fear closes your throat and you are rooted to the spot. Then... ouch! Something has bitten you on the bum! You see a small spider dropping off your robes and scurrying away into the darkness.</p>
<p>The pain in your bum gets you moving.</p>
<p>You slowly walk forwards wishing you could run back up the wooden steps to the safety of the hall above.</p>
<p>As you get closer you can just make out two round yellow eyes staring back at you, and between them a large... beak? Is Percy some kind of monster? Is he going to leap out at you and attack?</p>
<p>Your eyes adjust to the dark and you realise that you are staring at a gigantic pigeon, that's as tall as you are even sitting down.</p>
<p>&quot;Who are you?&quot; you ask.</p>
<p>&quot;Coo coo I'm Percy the Picking Pigeon and I will choose your house for you coo coo! Look into my eyes Arthur, look into my eyes...&quot;</p>
<p>You stare into the yellow eyes of the pigeon which seem to grow until they become the entire world.</p>
<p>&quot;Coo coo well, you're cowardly Arthur, coming here last in the line,&quot; says Percy. &quot;Maybe Hedgehog House is the one for you. Or maybe you are just a bit sneaky - and Snakefang House is best? Or perhaps hanging around last was a clever ploy? It does show that you can plan ahead, so Ravenwing maybe? But certainly not brave Lionpaw. Coo coo.&quot;</p>

<p>The boy looks up at you. &quot;Yep I'm going to Hogsnorts. Did you know that they have the biggest magical library in the country?&quot;</p>

Measuring up</h2>
<p>"Toast will burn and porridge bubble, measure this kid and save me the trouble!" shrieked witch number 2.
</p><p>The incantation complete, the magic tape measure zooms around your body like a whirlwind, measuring everything from your inside leg measurement, to the distance between your nostrils, to the length of your ear lobes.</p>
<p>At the same time a magic biro is writing down all these measurements on a notepad.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, in which you are frightened to move in case the tape measure accidentally shoots up your nose, the tape neatly rolls itself up and lands on a table.</p>
<p>Witch number 2 looks carefully at the scribbled numbers in the notepad and counts on her fingers.</p>
<p>She looks up at her sister and yells: &quot;Small!&quot;</p>
<p>As witch number 1 scuttles off to get a small robe for you, your Mum, who has been standing quietly to one side clears her throat.</p>
<p>&quot;Ahem, how much do these robes cost? I didn't see any prices when we came in the shop,&quot; says your Mum.</p>
<p>&quot;11 Golden Frigates and not an Acorn less!&quot; replies the witch.</p>
<p>&quot;11 Golden Frigates - how much is that in pounds?&quot; asks your Mum.</p>
<p>&quot;Pounds? Oh no deary, we only take wizard money in this shop.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Never mind Mum,&quot; you say, &quot;I'm sure we could just make the robes ourselves from some black material...&quot;</p>
<p>Snako Malboy snorts and rolls his eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Wait!&quot; exclaims the witch, &quot;We don't take pounds but we do offer <em>wagers</em>.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ok... can we do a wager and not pay anything?&quot; asks your mum.</p>
<p>&quot;I wager you can't guess my age,&quot; says the witch. &quot;If you can, you can keep the robe and get a free hat. If you fail you will stay in this shop for ever!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'll do it&quot; you say bravely, &quot;but I will need a clue.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How old are you boy?&quot; asks the witch.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm ten years old.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Here's your clue. In ten years, if you double your age then, and then double it again, that will be my age then. But how old am I, right now?&quot;</p><p></p>

Watertomes</h2>
<p>Now you look the part, it will be nice to be able to do a bit of magic! You head towards Watertomes bookshop, your mum following behind you.
</p><p>As you walk down the street you overhear all sorts of curious and wonderful snatches of conversation:</p>
<p>&quot;...I put in the eye of newt and you'll never guess what happened...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;....then my hat blew off into a swamp...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;...his own fault he never should have summoned that demon...&quot;</p>
<p>Watertomes is a small shop with an old wooden door and cramped dusty windows. You push the door open with a creak and enter hesitantly.</p>
<p>The inside is enormous: by some magic it is many times bigger than the outside. Brightly lit bookshelves stretch away from you to the left and right.</p>
<p>You see a boy with straight brown hair, about your age sitting on the floor, reading a book. He looks up at you as you walk in.</p>
<p>Do you:</p><p></p>

The flying car</h2>
<p>Mr Bleezeley gives his little blue car a proud tap on the bonnet. "She may not be the Hogsnorts Express," he says, "but this fine car will have you there in a jiffy, with a fair wind."
</p><p>You are in the station carpark, all standing next to the Bleezeleys' car.</p>
<p>&quot;Dad's enchanted the car to be able to fly,&quot; explains Aaron Bleezeley, &quot;so in <em>theory</em> we should be able to follow the train from above and get to Hogsnorts that way.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There's just one problem though Dad,&quot; says Robert Bleezeley, the oldest child. &quot;There's only room for four people in this car. If me, Alex, Aaron and also Arthur are going there's no room for you or Mum. We won't all fit.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't worry,&quot; says Mr Bleezeley, &quot;I'll just cast a spell on the sat nav to fly you there automatically, and then you can go by yourselves. Mum and I will stay here. Come on, in you get boys!&quot;</p>
<p>Robert and Alex get in the front seats and you and Aaron in the back.</p>
<p>Mr Bleezeley draws his magic wand, and gently raps the windscreen: &quot;<em>Fly, fly, fly up high, get to Hogsnorts through the sky.</em>&quot;</p>
<p>He lowers his wand and smiles at them. &quot;That should do the trick. Stand back everyone.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bye bye Arthur!&quot; shout your Dad and Evan, as the car engine splutters into life. &quot;Good luck!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bye bye Dad, bye bye Evan!&quot; you reply as the car starts moving forward and <em>upward</em> into the sky. &quot;See you later!&quot;</p>
<p>You watch the ground drop away beneath you in amazement as the car roars through the air.</p>
<p>Turning to the boys in the car with you: Aaron, Alex and Robert you:</p><p></p>

On the Hogsnorts Express</h2>
<p>Neither the boy from the robe shop nor the girl from the spell book shop seemed that friendly when you met them before, so you decide to try another carriage.
</p><p>Waving goodbye to your Dad and brother you run down the platform and leap into a carriage just as the doors are closing.</p>
<p>There are lots of children wearing wizard and witch outfits, some older, some younger. Most children are listening to headphones and playing with their phones and one or two are reading a book.</p>
<p>You spot a spare seat next to an unassuming young witch about your age and sit down next to her.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello,&quot; you say, keen to make friends. &quot;I'm Arthur Otley, what's your name?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Kensley Potato,&quot; comes back the quiet reply. &quot;I'm a first year.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So am I! Do you know what House you want to be in, when we get to Hogsnorts?&quot;</p>
<p>A look of defiance flashes in Kensley's eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;I know which houses I don't want to be in. I don't want to be Snakefang House, trying to take over the world. I don't want to be in Ravenwing House, thinking you're so much cleverer than everyone else. And I don't want to be in Lionpaw House, always <em>right</em> all the time and thumping anyone who is <em>wrong</em>.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You want to be in Hedgehog House,&quot; you say, not quite as a question.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes I do! All the other Houses tease the Hoggers for being boring, but they're not actually. They're not fighting, they're not power hungry, they're not clever clogs, they are just <em>normal</em>. Just normal, <em>ordinary</em> wizards trying to get through the term without getting our hats blasted off by a stray magic spell. And if you call that boring well then I <em>want</em> to be boring, thank you very much.&quot;</p>
<p>It does sound a bit boring, you think, but don't say anything. Instead you offer Kensley a Smarty from your sweet collection. She happily shares them with you and is quite excited when you choose a brown Smarty.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur, did you realise that brown is the colour of Hedgehog House? Maybe this is a sign that you will be in Hedgehog House too? Wouldn't you like that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well maybe. I don't want a stray spell blasting my hat off, I guess.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course you don't,&quot; says Kensley. &quot;That's why you need to keep your head down with the Hoggers - we call ourselves Hoggers in Hedgehog House.&quot;</p>
<p>While you are talking the train chugs into daylight, and the railway tracks emerge from the dark tunnel out into the countryside.</p>
<p>You twist in your seat to peer out of the window. As far as you can see there are rolling hills covered in pine trees. In the distance, craggy mountains emerge, their tops clouded in mist. It looks like nowhere you have ever seen before, except perhaps in the illustrations to one of your favourite books, The Hobbit.</p>
<p>You feel like you have entered a magical new land and your adventure has truly begun.</p>
<p>A magically amplified voice interrupts your daydreams of dwarves and dragons, trolls and treasure.</p>
<p>&quot;Train terminates here. All change please, all change. Mind the gap.&quot;</p>
<p>Hogsnorts station!  This is it. You've arrived.</p><p></p>

A visit to Spellwitches </h2>
<p>With your magic wand clasped tightly in your hand, you decide that you need to look like a wizard too.
</p><p>The shop has large storefront windows. Inside the windows manikins have been arranged wearing black witch and wizard robes. The manikins are in a variety of action poses, such as just about to cast a spell, or frozen running away from a dragon.</p>
<p>But they have clearly been magically enchanted because every now and again one of the manikins will change their position to something else, moving smoothly with astonishing realism. You look at the manikins carefully - they really are amazingly life-like, even down to the expressions of surprise on their faces.</p>
<p>You and your mum make a little bell dingle as you push open the door.</p>
<p>In front of you are racks and racks of wizard robes, all black. Above some racks a sign says 'small', above others it says 'medium', and others 'large'.</p>
<p>Shelves cover the walls and the shelves are covered in pointy black hats.</p>
<p>&quot;May I help you at all?&quot;</p>
<p>You and your mum both jump - a witch with a totally green face leaps out from behind a rack of black robes just in front of you.</p>
<p>&quot;Just browsing are you?&quot;</p>
<p>You jump again as another witch, looking identical to the first, pops out from a rack of clothes behind you.</p>
<p>&quot;Aargh!&quot; you exclaim. You take a breath and calm yourself and clear your throat.</p>
<p>&quot;Robes?&quot; you squeak &quot;For Hogsnorts?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are in the right place my little dear&quot; said green witch number 1. &quot;Let's see how you measure up!&quot;</p>
<p>The two witches take you to a side room where a magic tape measure is already taking the measurements of a pale looking boy about your age.</p>
<p>The boy looks at you with an expression that could either be a sneer or a smile, you can't quite be sure.</p>

A new friend?</h2>
<p>It will be good to get to know someone you might be going to school with, perhaps he can tell you what it's like.
</p><p>&quot;Hello&quot; you say to the boy. &quot;I'm Arthur. Are you going to Hogsnorts?&quot;</p>
<p>The boy looks up at you. &quot;Yep I'm going to Hogsnorts. Did you know that they have the biggest magical library in the country?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No...&quot; you say. You wonder how many other magical libraries there are in the country.</p>
<p>&quot;Anyway I'm Daniel Colliers-Wood. And this is my little brother Robin Colliers-Wood.&quot;</p>
<p>You notice another boy sitting just round the next bookshelf from Daniel, reading a comic book about a policeman with the body of a man and the head of a dog.</p>
<p>&quot;Daniel,&quot; you ask &quot;Do you know much about Hogsnorts? What it's like when you get there I mean?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I've read all about it. Well the main thing to know is that there are four &quot;houses&quot; or teams you could call them. The best house is Ravenwing house, that's where I want to go, Ravenwing House has that big library I told you about. The Ravenwings love studying. The other houses are Lion House for the brave, Snakefang House for the powerful, and Hedgehog House for the prickly. You will probably be in Hedgehog House.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No I won't!&quot; you protest automatically.</p>
<p>&quot;Alright Mr Prickles,&quot; says Daniel. &quot;I was just trying to wind you up. Anyway no one really knows which house they will be in until they get to Hogsnorts.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I want to go to Snakefang house, that would be so cool!&quot; pipes up Daniel's younger brother Robin.</p>
<p>&quot;Listen young man - Daniel was it?&quot; your mum interrupts &quot;I'm sure Arthur will be in Lion House, he is a very brave boy. Do you remember Arthur when you got stung by a wasp and you didn't even cry?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mu-um!&quot; you complain. Turning back to Daniel: &quot;Anyway Daniel, see you around.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bye bye Arthur&quot; says Daniel picking up his book.</p><p></p>

Down the toilet</h2>
<p>You decide to go to the toilet - apart from anything else you do feel a bit nervous and it <i>is</i> a good idea to have a wee before you get on the train.
</p><p>As you approach the station toilets you look down and are surprised to see five spiders walking in a line one after the other towards the disabled loo. Reasoning that this is not typical behaviour for spiders, and that anything weird might well be magical, you walk in the same direction.</p>
<p>Your reasoning is correct. As you approach the disabled toilet you are excited to see that the door is outlined in a magical golden glow. This must be the right place!</p>
<p>You push open the door and you, your Dad and Evan go inside. Inside you see... just a normal toilet.</p>
<p>You look around for some sort of a clue but apart from a few discarded segments of toilet paper on the floor everything looks exactly as it should. Even the spiders are nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>&quot;Well it seems like this is a dead end Arthur, but you might as well do a wee now we're here.&quot; proposes Dad.</p><p></p>

Measuring up</h2>
<p>"Toast will burn and porridge bubble, measure up this boy and save me the trouble!" shrieked witch number 2.
</p><p>The incantation complete, the magic tape measure zooms around your body like a whirlwind, measuring everything from your inside leg measurement, to the distance between your nostrils, to the length of your ear lobes.</p>
<p>At the same time a magic biro is writing down all these measurements on a notepad.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, in which you are frightened to move in case the tape measure accidentally shoots up your nose, the tape neatly rolls itself up and lands on a table.</p>
<p>Witch number 2 looks carefully at the scribbled numbers in the notepad and counts on her fingers.</p>
<p>She looks up at her sister and yells: &quot;Small!&quot;</p>
<p>As witch number 1 scuttles off to get a small robe for you, your Mum, who has been standing quietly to one side clears her throat.</p>
<p>&quot;Is there any chance we could do some sort of challenge or test?&quot; your mum asks. &quot;And get a discount of say, 100%? I'm afraid we didn't bring any wizard money...&quot;</p>
<p>Snako Malboy snorts and rolls his eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;A test? A challenge? No deary. What we like are <em>wagers</em>&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ok whatever. Can we do a wager and not pay anything?&quot; your mum says.</p>
<p>&quot;I wager you can't guess my age. If you can, you can keep the robe and get a free hat. If you fail you will stay in this shop for ever!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'll do it&quot; you say bravely, &quot;but I will need a clue.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How old are you boy?&quot; asks the witch.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm ten years old.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Here's your clue. In ten years time I will be ten times as old as you are now. How old am I, right now?&quot;</p><p></p>

Flying high</h2>
<p>"Would anyone like a Smarty?" you ask.
</p><p>As you share the brightly coloured chocolate treats with your three new friends, you ask them about the school.</p>
<p>&quot;We've been at Hogsnorts for three years now, Robert and me&quot; says Alex. &quot;And I can tell you, it's amazing. Hidden passageways, secret towers, dark dungeons, it's got everything. The only trouble is we have to share it with Snakefang House, the slimiest bunch of bullies you can imagine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's right,&quot; adds Robert. &quot;We're in Lionpaw House, so it's our job to stand up to bullies like them whenever we get the chance. If I haven't punched a Snakefang on the nose at least once, it's not a good week.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Err ok&quot; you reply. &quot;And what about the other houses?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh they're ok. Boring old Hedgehog House and brain box Ravenwings. Yes they're ok but I wouldn't want to be one.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes that's right Arthur,&quot; says Aaron. &quot;Everyone wants to be in Lionpaw House, the home of the brave. I'm going to be in Lionpaw House for sure.&quot; Aaron starts shadow boxing the air in front of him.</p>
<p>You consider this as you pick out a red Smarty from the pile.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey look you chose a red Smarty!&quot; exclaims Aaron. &quot;Did you know that red and gold are the colours of Lionpaw House? You chose red so maybe you will be in Lionpaw House too!&quot;</p>

Wanderful Wands</h2>
<p>You decide to visit Wally's Wanderful Wands shop next. Now that you have your spellbook you want to get your hands on a wand as soon as possible and start doing some magic.
</p><p>The sign above Wally's shop is a giant wand dangling from a chain above the shop door. It swings gently to and fro even though there is no breeze to speak of, and little crackles of electric-gold magic arc over its surface.</p>
<p>You can't help thinking that this wand must also double up as Wally's security system.</p>
<p>With a nervous glance upwards you and your Mum enter the shop.</p>
<p>The inside is sparklingly clean and glass cabinets are artfully arranged around the shop. Each cabinet contains three or four magic wands, resting on little red cushions with gold tassles. It all looks <em>very</em> expensive.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur are you sure this is the only wand shop?&quot; asks your mum. &quot;Perhaps there is another one that is not quite so err... so un...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Welcome!&quot; a smooth rich voice startles them from the back of the room. &quot;Welcome to Wally's Wanderful Wand shop! And madam I can assure you that this is the only wand shop in Hippoto Mews. But fear not I'm sure we can find a wand that is the perfect match for young Arthur.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How did you know my name?&quot; you ask in surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the many branches of magic in which I am an expert, young Arthur, is mind reading. Just by looking into your eyes I can see the entire contents of your brain. I can also do it by looking in your ears, in your mouth, up your nose... any hole works to tell the truth. But I usually prefer the eyes. Also your Mum called you Arthur when you entered my shop.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you are Wally I suppose?&quot; says your Mum.</p>
<p>&quot;I am indeed, dear madam. Did you divine this from looking in my ear hole? Remarkable!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No I figured it out when you said this was your shop.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Quite so. We are all mind-readers to some degree.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Wally&quot; you interrupt &quot;can I have a wand please?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No you cannot have <em>a</em> wand Arthur. But what you can have is <em>the</em> wand. Every wand is unique! You are unique! You require the exact match for your particular thaumaturgical resonance. Your thaumaturgic twin as it were. The most powerful - the only! - tool you will ever need as a magician.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That sounds nice,&quot; says your Mum, &quot;but we don't want anything <em>too</em> fancy. The thing is we don't have much, or in fact any, wizard money. Frigates I mean.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The wand is of course priceless. I do offer a 10% discount for Hogsnorts' students in their first year. But for you I will increase this discount to 100% if - if! - Arthur and I can establish a true connection of minds, and I can see that you Arthur are a worthy wandholder.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A 100% discount you say? That's a good deal. Arthur see if you can connect up your mind with Wally's love.&quot; your Mum suggests.</p>
<p>Wally crouches down in front of you and holds your ears gently but firmly forcing you to look deep into his blue grey eyes. At first nothing happens. But after just a few moments you get the strange sensation of being <em>pulled</em>  towards his eyeballs; his black pupils feel like they are <em>dragging</em> you inwards.</p>
<p>&quot;Good Arthur, very good!&quot; says Wally. &quot;I believe that the magical connection between our minds is now established, and astonishingly quickly too! You must have deep reserves of magic.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur I need you to think of a number. If I can read your mind and tell you the number you were thinking of this will be proof that the magical mind connection is working properly.</p>
<p>&quot;First I need you to think of a number between 1 and 10. But don't tell me what it is! Have you got one?&quot;</p>
<p>You think of a number and nod your head.</p>
<p>&quot;Now&quot; says Wally, &quot;I need you to multiply this number by 9. 9 is a number with strong magical properties&quot; he explains.</p>
<p>You multiply your number by 9.</p>
<p>&quot;The next step&quot; he says, &quot;is to split your answer into the two digits and add those two digits together. For example if your answer is 13 (and I know it is not!) then you would split it into 1 and 3, then add that 1 and 3 together, so 1 + 3 = 4.</p>
<p>&quot;Ok&quot; you say as you do the sum in your head.</p>
<p>&quot;Now take that answer and multiply it by 9. Can you do that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes&quot; you reply.</p>
<p>&quot;Now turn to that number! And we will see if our minds are connected.&quot;</p><p></p>

<p>Shelves cover the walls and the shelves are covered in pointy black hats.</p>
<p>&quot;May I help you at all?&quot;</p>
<p>You and your mum both jump - a witch with a totally green face leaps out from behind a rack of black robes just in front of you.</p>
<p>&quot;Just browsing are you?&quot;</p>
<p>You jump again as another witch, looking identical to the first, pops out from a rack of clothes behind you.</p>
<p>&quot;Aargh!&quot; you exclaim. You take a breath and calm yourself and clear your throat.</p>
<p>&quot;Robes?&quot; you squeak &quot;For Hogsnorts?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are in the right place my little dear&quot; said green witch number 1. &quot;Let's see how you measure up!&quot;</p>
<p>The two witches take you to a side room where a magic tape measure is already taking the measurements of a pale looking boy about your age.</p>
<p>The boy looks at you with an expression that could either be a sneer or a smile, you can't quite be sure.</p>
<p>Do you:</p><p></p>
<p class="text-centre">............................................................</p>
<div class="text-choice">
<p>1. Strike up a conversation with the boy, he may be a future classmate ~ <strong>Go to number 62</strong></p>
<p>2. Keep your mouth shut, you just want to get this done and get out of here ~ <strong>Go to number 25</strong></p>

Where is the Hogsnort&#39;s Express?</h2>
<p>You check your rucksack for the one hundredth time. Carefully folded wizard robes: check. Year one spellbook: check. One magic wand: check. Spare pair of socks: check.
</p><p>You've got everything you need to go to the Hogsnorts school of wizardry!</p>
<p>The only thing you need to figure out now is how to get there.</p>
<p>You are waiting by the ticket barriers at Leeds railway station with your brother Evan and your Dad. Your Dad is checking his watch and looking up at the train departure board anxiously.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur&quot; he says, &quot;it is ten minutes until the train is supposed to leave and I can't see Hognsorts on the departure board anywhere. Do you know where we are supposed to go?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;On the letter it just says: <em>the train will depart at 9.34 precisely from Leeds railway station</em>. But it doesn't say <em>where</em> in Leeds railway station.&quot;</p>
<p>Just then you notice something strange. One of the ticket inspectors by the ticket barriers is wearing a pointy black hat and sun glasses. It could just be coincidence or maybe he knows <em>how to find the magic train!</em></p>
<p>&quot;Come on Evan, Dad,&quot; you say and walk over to talk to the ticket inspector.</p>
<p>&quot;Excuse me,&quot; you ask &quot;do you know where we can find the Hogsnorts Express?&quot;</p>
<p>The ticket inspector turns to look straight at you, and removes his sun glasses. You are startled to see that his eyes are completely white with no visible pupil at all. His voice comes out as a rasp:</p>
<div class="text-poem">
<p>&quot;<em>The Express you seek,<br>
Will leave off-peak,<br>
With a puff of steam and a piercing shriek.<br>
But first you need to take a leak.</em>&quot;</p>
</div>
<p>He then replaces his sun glasses, turns away from you and doesn't say another word.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a riddle!&quot; you exclaim. &quot;The train will leave off-peak - yes that makes sense it will leave just after 9.30. With a puff of steam and a piercing shriek - that must mean it is a steam train with a whistle. But what does the last part about taking a leak mean?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think he is telling you to go to the toilet before you get on the train&quot; says Dad. &quot;A last wee: very sensible advice.&quot;</p>
<p>Just then you see an odd looking family dashing through the station. The two adults are puffing and out of breath and the three children are <em>wearing wizard robes!</em>&quot;</p>
<p>Do you:</p><p></p>
<p class="text-centre">............................................................</p>
<div class="text-choice">
<p>1. Visit the toilet to see if you can unravel the ticket inspectors riddle. ~ <strong>Go to number 31</strong></p>
<p>2. Go and talk to the odd looking family, perhaps they can just tell you where the train is without any silly puzzles. ~ <strong>Go to number 14</strong></p>

Hippoto Mews</h2>
<p>"Where did you say that magic trick shop is love?" your Mum says to you.
</p><p>&quot;It's not a magic trick shop Mum, it is a <em>real</em> magic shop, lots of shops! The Letter said that they were on a street called Hippoto Mews in London.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hippoto Mews? Well I can't see it on the map on my phone.&quot; said Mum.</p>
<p>You and your mum have come to a dead end, just a brick wall at the end of a street. You are sure that you have followed the instructions correctly and Hippoto Mews should be just here. But... there's nothing.</p>
<p>Then it comes to you - the Letter! Didn't it say something about tapping out a secret code? You step up to the brick wall and take a deep breath.</p>
<p>Will you try:</p>
<p></p>
<p class="text-centre">............................................................</p>
<div class="text-choice">
<p>1. TAP TAP TAP... TAP TAPPITY TAP ~ <strong>Go to number 3</strong></p>

Measuring up</h2>
<p>"Toast will burn and porridge bubble, measure this kid and save me the trouble!" shrieked witch number 2.
</p><p>The incantation complete, the magic tape measure zooms around your body like a whirlwind, measuring everything from your inside leg measurement, to the distance between your nostrils, to the length of your ear lobes.</p>
<p>At the same time a magic biro is writing down all these measurements on a notepad.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, in which you are frightened to move in case the tape measure accidentally shoots up your nose, the tape neatly rolls itself up and lands on a table.</p>
<p>Witch number 2 looks carefully at the scribbled numbers in the notepad and counts on her fingers.</p>
<p>She looks up at her sister and yells: &quot;Small!&quot;</p>
<p>As witch number 1 scuttles off to get a small robe for you, your Mum, who has been standing quietly to one side clears her throat.</p>
<p>&quot;Is there any chance we could do some sort of challenge or test?&quot; your mum asks. &quot;And get a discount of say, 100%? I'm afraid we didn't bring any wizard money...&quot;</p>
<p>Snako Malboy snorts and rolls his eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;A test? A challenge? No deary. What we like are <em>wagers</em>&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ok whatever. Can we do a wager and not pay anything?&quot; your mum says.</p>
<p>&quot;I wager you can't guess my age. If you can, you can keep the robe and get a free hat. If you fail you will stay in this shop for ever!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'll do it&quot; you say bravely, &quot;but I will need a clue.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How old are you boy?&quot; asks the witch.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm ten years old.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Here's your clue. If you multiply your age by ten, then add nine... That's the age I will be in ten year's time. How old am I, right now?&quot;</p><p></p>
<p class="text-centre">............................................................</p>
<div class="text-choice">
<p>1. Turn to the number that is the age of the witch ~ <strong>Go to the number of your answer</strong></p>

The magical void</h2>
<p>You find yourself in a magical place that exists outside time and outside space.
</p><p>The only way to reach here is by powerful magic. No path can take you here. No decision you make will lead you to this place.</p>
<p>Only the very best wizards can command this level of magical power.</p>
<p>You appear to be floating in a sort of void. If you want to move you only have to <em>think</em> yourself moving. Across this void glimmer infinitely long twists and curtains of shimmering golden sparkles: raw magic.</p>
<p>It is peaceful. You feel relaxed and calm. The troubles of the world do not reach here.</p>
<p>You think yourself over to a golden pillar of glittering magical dust and let it run over your hand. You feel the magic enter your veins and your magical strength increases further.</p>
<p>Now that you have found this place and touched the magic dust you only have to think of the magic number &quot;42&quot; and you will be instantly teleported back here.</p>
<p>Looking around you notice transparent rainbow bubbles floating between the twisting columns of golden dust.</p>
<p>You look closer.</p>
<p>Each bubble is the size of a football. Inside the bubbles you can see figures moving - people. You recognise <em>yourself</em> in the bubbles.</p>
<p>You realise that the bubbles must be windows into your past - and your future. Each bubble is an important moment in your life. As soon as you realise this you also know that all you have to do is reach into a bubble and you will be transported to that time and place.</p>
<p>A feeling of deep happiness settles upon you. You can go to any back - or forwards - to anytime in your life it is your choice.</p>
<p>Or should you <em>double</em> your efforts, try <em>two times as much</em> as you are now, and explore this magical void a little more?</p>
<p>But anytime you want you can come back here, to this shimmering golden magical void, filled with peace - just by thinking the magic number: 42.</p>
<p>Will you reach into a bubble - or linger here a while longer?</p><p></p>
<p class="text-centre">............................................................</p>
<div class="text-choice">
<p>1. The bubble at the start, when the letter arrives. Go to number 1. ~ <strong>Go to the number of your answer</strong></p>

The first feast</h2>
<p>Everyone on Lionpaw table welcomes you with shouts of unrestrained joy. 
</p><p>&quot;Well done Arthur!&quot; yells Alex Bleezeley, looking none the worse for his crash landing. &quot;You're in the best House now!&quot; He and his brother Robert Bleezeley pound your back vigorously.</p>
<p>The children around the table spontaneously break into the Lionpaw House chant, prancing around and shadow boxing some imaginary foe.</p>
<p>&quot;South paw, North paw, we score, Lionpaw!&quot;</p>
<p>You have a huge grin on your face and it only gets wider when - the rest of the House Sorting complete - Slumblebore magically conjures up an incredible feast for dinner.</p>
<p>From out of thin air materializes platters of roast beef and boiled sprouts, Yorkshire pudding and mashed turnips, shepherds pie and boiled broccoli, toad in the hole and boiled potatoes, bubble and squeak and boiled carrots, apple crumble with strawberry ice cream, and spotted dick drowning in custard.</p>
<p>&quot;Shepherds pie, my favourite!&quot; Aaron Bleezeley, a boy who was also chosen for Lionpaw House, licks his lips.</p>
<p>In a rite of initiation all the first years crack open the eggs they received from Percy the Picking Pigeon and guzzle the contents raw.</p>
<p>You and Aaron, raw egg running down your chins, grin at each other, and you are certain you will be best friends.</p>
<p>Then you eat more than you have ever eaten before, enjoying yourself immensely. You wonder if Slumblebore is somehow making the food magically disappear after it enters your stomach, in a similar way to how he made the food appear on the table. But finally you realise you can't cram anything more into your belly, and let out a huge belch.</p>
<p>&quot;Children!&quot; Slumblebore stands, his beard streaked with mashed turnips and the odd boiled potato. He raises his hands for silence. &quot;Children! Now we have eaten our fill it is time for bed. Prefects lead the students to the House towers. And remember: the dungeons are off limits this term. We don't know what's down there, and neither do we want to.&quot;</p>
<p>The children rise to their feet, clutching their distended tummies, and prepare to leave the hall.</p>
<p>You turn to Aaron Bleezeley and say:</p><p></p>
<p class="text-centre">............................................................</p>
<div class="text-choice">
<p>1. "Hey Aaron, let's check out the Lionpaw House dormitories, I'm sure they will be so cool!" ~ <strong>Go to number 219</strong></p>

Your first spell book</h2>
<p>"I've turned your name into the number 44" you tell Sue.
</p><p>&quot;Well done! You've transformed my name into a number... and that number into your story. I can sense that you will be a powerful wizard one day.&quot;</p>
<p>Sue hands you the red spell book. It is even heavier than it looks and feels as if it is vibrating very slightly, as if it is somehow... alive.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you&quot; you whisper, as you hold on tightly to your very first magical spell book.</p>
<p>&quot;Well done Arthur!&quot; says your Mum as you walk out of the door together, &quot;That was so clever! And you saved us 14 Frigates! Now let's get your robes!&quot;</p><p></p>

The first feast</h2>
<p>Everyone on Ravenwing table is delighted to have you in their house, and welcome you warmly. 
</p><p>&quot;Welcome to Ravenwing Arthur!&quot; says one girl, who looks like she is in the oldest year. &quot;Congratulations on your <em>intelligent</em> choice. You will find your new house mates very convivial companions I'm sure!&quot; The girl shakes your hand and pats you on the shoulder.</p>
<p>The children around the table spontaneously break into the Ravenwing House chant, flapping their hands like wings at the side of their heads while chanting the House chant.</p>
<p>&quot;Mind over matter, Ravenwings comin' at yaaaa!&quot;</p>
<p>You have a huge grin on your face and it only gets wider when - the rest of the House Sorting complete - Slumblebore magically conjures up an incredible feast for dinner.</p>
<p>From out of thin air materializes platters of roast beef and boiled sprouts, Yorkshire pudding and mashed turnips, shepherds pie and boiled broccoli, toad in the hole and boiled potatoes, bubble and squeak and boiled carrots, apple crumble with strawberry ice cream, and spotted dick drowning in custard.</p>
<p>&quot;Yorkshire pudding, my favourite!&quot; says Daniel Colliers-Wood who was also chosen for Ravenwing House, and licks his lips. Before long you are chatting like old friends.</p>
<p>In a rite of initiation all the first years crack open the eggs they received from Percy the Picking Pigeon and guzzle the contents raw.</p>
<p>Then you eat more than you have ever eaten before, enjoying yourself immensely. You wonder if Slumblebore is somehow making the food magically disappear after it enters your stomach, in a similar way to how he made the food appear on the table.

A visit to Spellwitches</h2>
<p>You may have your spell book and your magic wand but you need to look like a wizard too.
</p><p>The shop has large storefront windows. Inside the windows manikins have been arranged wearing black witch and wizard robes. The manikins are in a variety of action poses, such as just about to cast a spell, or frozen running away from a dragon.</p>
<p>But they have clearly been magically enchanted because every now and again one of the manikins will change their position to something else, moving smoothly with astonishing realism. You look at the manikins carefully - they really are amazingly life-like, even down to the expressions of surprise on their faces.</p>
<p>You and your mum make a little bell dingle as you push open the door.</p>
<p>In front of you are racks and racks of wizard robes, all black. Above some racks a sign says 'small', above others it says 'medium', and others 'large'.</p>
<p>Shelves cover the walls and the shelves are covered in pointy black hats.</p>
<p>&quot;May I help you at all?&quot;</p>
<p>You and your mum both jump - a witch with a totally green face leaps out from behind a rack of black robes just in front of you.</p>
<p>&quot;Just browsing are you?&quot;</p>
<p>You jump again as another witch, looking identical to the first, pops out from a rack of clothes behind you.</p>
<p>&quot;Aargh!&quot; you exclaim. You take a breath and calm yourself and clear your throat.</p>
<p>&quot;Robes?&quot; you squeak &quot;For Hogsnorts?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are in the right place my little dear&quot; said green witch number 1. &quot;Let's see how you measure up!&quot;</p>
<p>The two witches take you to a side room where a magic tape measure is already taking the measurements of a pale looking boy about your age.</p>
<p>The boy looks at you with an expression that could either be a sneer or a smile, you can't quite be sure.</p>
<p>Do you:</p><p></p>

 Snako Malboy</h2>
<p>"Hello," you say to the boy "my name's Arthur Otley and I'm going to Hogsnorts. Who are you?"
</p><p>The boy does his sneering smile at you again.</p>
<p>&quot;Snako Malboy. Yes I too am going to Hogsnorts. My father went to Hogsnorts. My grandfather went to Hogsnorts. So did his father and so on up to 72 generations and the founding of the school. Sylvester Snake - yes <em>the</em> Sylvester Snake is my direct ancestor. And my mother and their mothers too. So yes I am going to Hogsnorts.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who is Sylvester Snake?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sylvester Snake is only the founder of Snake House! The best house in the school. I'm going to be in Snake House. Snake House is for the really powerful wizards, like I will be one day. You will be in Hedgehog House I suppose.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I haven't decided yet&quot; you reply.</p>
<p>&quot;Well if you want to be Snake House like me you have to be strong and ruthless. Snake House rules yah sssssssss!&quot;</p>
<p>Snako Malboy stuck his tongue in and out of his mouth like a snake and hissed - not an easy thing to do at the same time. You are impressed.</p>
<p>At that point the magic tape measure is finished with Snako and moves over to you.</p><p></p>

<p>"Toast will burn and porridge bubble, measure up this boy and save me the trouble!" shrieked witch number 2.

Shopping spree</h2>
<p>To your surprise, the mortar between the bricks starts glowing with a golden light. This must be a secret magical entrance to Hippoto Mews!
</p><p>You step back as the golden light gets brighter, and all of a sudden the space where the wall was suddenly <em>twists sideways</em> to leave a perfectly round hole in the brickwork, big enough to walk through.</p>
<p>As the hole opens the noise of a busy shopping street pours through. You can see old fashioned looking shops and houses all crowded together. And everywhere you look: magicians! Old ones, young ones, tall ones, short ones, all dressed up in robes and pointy hats.</p>
<p>You did it!</p>
<p>&quot;Come on mum!&quot; you cry and hop through the hole.</p>
<p>Your mum looks stunned, but follows you through. As she enters Hippoto Mews the brick wall twists back into place.</p>
<p>You remember that you need three things to take with you to Hogsnorts:</p>
<ul>
<li>a wand</li>
<li>a spell book</li>
<li>a wizard's robe</li>

In the bin</h2>
<p>Before you can stop him Dad grabs the letter from your hands, rips it into tiny pieces and throws it into the recycling bin.
</p><p>&quot;There's no point in reading that rubbish&quot; says Dad, &quot;it's just someone trying to sell you double glazing or something.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But Dad, that was for me! It had my name on it!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You should see the stuff I get with my name on it!&quot; replies Dad. &quot;Selling windows, selling contact lenses, selling insurance. No it's better off in the recycling bin where it can be put to a good use, like making toilet paper.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But Da-ad!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sorry Arthur, but we don't need new windows, you're too young for contact lenses and we've already got insurance. Anyway who wants to hear my latest song...&quot;</p>
<p>You sigh as Dad starts singing the song he has written.</p>
<p>You are sure that there was something really <em>important</em> about that letter. Something really <em>special</em>.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The next morning as you munch your toast, you hear the letter box flap open.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur!&quot; shouts Evan from the front door. &quot;There's another letter for you!&quot;</p>
<p>Another letter! You must be really popular!</p>
<p>You race down the hallway to get the letter, but your Dad is already there with the letter in his hands and a frown on his face.</p>
<p>&quot;More junk mail!&quot; he says.</p>

Watertomes</h2>
<p>Now you have a wand it would be nice to have some spells to cast, you decide and head towards Watertomes bookshop, your mum following behind you.
</p><p>As you walk down the street you overhear all sorts of curious and wonderful snatches of conversation:</p>
<p>&quot;...I put in the eye of newt and you'll never guess what happened...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;....then my hat blew off into a swamp...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;...his own fault he never should have summoned that demon...&quot;</p>
<p>Watertomes is a small shop with an old wooden door and cramped dusty windows. You push the door open with a creak and enter hesitantly.</p>
<p>The inside is enormous: by some magic it is many times bigger than the outside. Brightly lit bookshelves stretch away from you to the left and right.</p>
<p>You see a boy with straight brown hair, about your age sitting on the floor, reading a book. He looks up at you as you walk in.</p>
<p>Do you:</p><p></p>

Wanderful Wands</h2>
<p>Last stop: Wally's Wanderful Wands shop. Soon you will get your hands on a wand and start doing some magic. Oh yeah.
</p><p>The sign above Wally's shop is a giant wand dangling from a chain above the shop door. It swings gently to and fro even though there is no breeze to speak of, and little crackles of electric-gold magic arc over its surface.</p>
<p>With a nervous glance upwards you and your Mum enter the shop.</p>
<p>The inside is sparklingly clean and glass cabinets are artfully arranged around the shop. Each cabinet contains three or four magic wands, resting on little red cushions with gold tassles. It all looks <em>very</em> expensive.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur are you sure this is the only wand shop?&quot; asks your mum. &quot;Perhaps there is another one that is not quite so err... so un...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Welcome!&quot; a smooth rich voice startles them from the back of the room. &quot;Welcome to Wally's Wanderful Wand shop! And madam I can assure you that this is the only wand shop in Hippoto Mews. But fear not I'm sure we can find a wand that is the perfect match for young Arthur.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How did you know my name?&quot; you ask in surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the many branches of magic in which I am an expert, young Arthur, is mind reading. Just by looking into your eyes I can see the entire contents of your brain. I can also do it by looking in your ears, in your mouth, up your nose... any hole works to tell the truth. But I usually prefer the eyes. Also your Mum called you Arthur when you entered my shop.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you are Wally I suppose?&quot; says your Mum.</p>
<p>&quot;I am indeed, dear madam. Did you divine this from looking in my ear hole? Remarkable!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No I figured it out when you said this was your shop.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Quite so. We are all mind-readers to some degree.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Wally&quot; you interrupt &quot;can I have a wand please?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No you cannot have <em>a</em> wand Arthur. But what you can have is <em>the</em> wand. Every wand is unique! You are unique! You require the exact match for your particular thaumaturgical resonance. Your thaumaturgic twin as it were. The most powerful - the only! - tool you will ever need as a magician.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That sounds nice,&quot; says your Mum, &quot;but we don't want anything <em>too</em> fancy. Or expensive.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The wand is of course priceless. But you can buy one for 100 Golden Frigates.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Golden what now?&quot; asks your Mum. &quot;Don't you take pounds? I don't have any Golden Frigates.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's wizard money only in this shop I'm afraid. I do offer a 10% discount for Hogsnorts' students in their first year... But for you I will increase this discount to 100% if - if! - Arthur and I can establish a true connection of minds, and I can see that you Arthur are a worthy wandholder.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A 100% discount you say? That's a good deal. Arthur see if you can connect up your mind with Wally's love.&quot; your Mum suggests.</p>
<p>Wally crouches down in front of you and holds your ears gently but firmly forcing you to look deep into his blue grey eyes. At first nothing happens. But after just a few moments you get the strange sensation of being <em>pulled</em>  towards his eyeballs; his black pupils feel like they are <em>dragging</em> you inwards.</p>
<p>&quot;Good Arthur, very good!&quot; says Wally. &quot;I believe that the magical connection between our minds is now established, and astonishingly quickly too! You must have deep reserves of magic.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur I need you to think of a number. If I can read your mind and tell you the number you were thinking of this will be proof that the magical mind connection is working properly.</p>
<p>&quot;First I need you to think of a number between 1 and 10. But don't tell me what it is! Have you got one?&quot;</p>
<p>You think of a number and nod your head.</p>
<p>&quot;Now&quot; says Wally, &quot;I need you to multiply this number by 9. 9 is a number with strong magical properties&quot; he explains.</p>
<p>You multiply your number by 9.</p>
<p>&quot;The next step&quot; he says, &quot;is to split your answer into the two digits and add those two digits together. For example if your answer is 13 (and I know it is not!) then you would split it into 1 and 3, then add that 1 and 3 together, so 1 + 3 = 4.</p>
<p>&quot;Ok&quot; you say as you do the sum in your head.</p>
<p>&quot;Now take that answer and multiply it by 7. Can you do that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes&quot; you reply.</p>
<p>&quot;Now turn to that number! And we will see if our minds are connected.&quot;</p><p></p>

Welcome to Hognsorts</h2>
<p>"Welcome students!" Professor Slumblebore, the headmaster of Hogsnorts School of Magic, smiles down at the assembled children, yellowish teeth glinting through his long grey beard.
</p><p>&quot;I have a few things to say to you before the House Sorting ceremony, where the first years are allocated to their Houses.</p>
<p>&quot;Firstly, study hard!</p>
<p>&quot;Secondly, five points deducted from Lionpaw House due to Robert and Alex Bleezeley piloting an unauthorised flying car in Hogsnorts airspace and endangering the lives of themselves and all the other children in the school when they drove straight at the flying monkeys carrying all the students to Hogsnorts.&quot;</p>
<p>A groan went up from all the children in Lionpaw House who shoot venomous looks at Robert and Alex.</p>
<p>&quot;Thirdly, ten points awarded to Lionpaw House due to an <em>excellent</em> emergency landing by Robert Bleezeley on the Hogsnorts school lawn!&quot;</p>
<p>Slumblebore beamed at them and the Lionpaw kids cheered, and slapped Robert and Alex on the back, laughing.</p>
<p>&quot;Fourthly, we appear to have an insect infestation in the school. Our Care of Magical Creatures Professor Mr Knid is leading the eradication efforts - &quot; Slumblebore pauses to acknowledge a flamboyantly caped teacher sitting next to him &quot; - although so far the little pests have proved stubbornly resistant. So I would ask all students that if they come across a spider in a corridor or in the classroom, please tread on it.&quot;</p>
<p>You notice Professor Knid grimace, no doubt embarrassed about his failure to control the infestation.</p>
<p>&quot;Fifthly, on <em>no account</em> are any children to enter the dungeon this term. We have picked up indications of some <em>extremely</em> malevolent magic taking place down there. I have cast an enchantment of locking on the door and we are going to leave whatever it is going on down there <em>well alone</em>, thank you!&quot;</p>
<p>You notice all the other children whispering to each other - what could be going on in that dungeon that makes even Slumblebore afraid?</p>
<p>&quot;Lastly, despite what I said last year I'm afraid Hogsnorts still doesn't have an internet connection. As you know the magical aurora interferes with mobile phone signals, and I'm afraid Professor Adeptus has not yet been able to figure out the correct incantations to get the WiFi router working.&quot;</p>
<p>Another groan, this time from all of the students, followed by disappointed muttering.</p>
<p>&quot;But now, on to the child sorting!&quot; Slumbedore raises his hands for silence. &quot;Open the hole!&quot;</p>
<p>A student scurries forward and pulls a lever by the platform at the front of the hall. Just in front of Slumblebore a huge stone flagstone slides slowly to one side leaving an opening in the floor.</p>
<p>Craning your neck, you can see nothing but darkness, and some wooden steps leading down inside. There is total silence in the hall as if the students don't dare even to breathe.</p>
<p>From out of the hole emerges... a noise. A sort of high pitched musical <em>voice</em> but made by what you have no idea.</p>
<p>&quot;Silence everybody,&quot; instructs Slumblebore, &quot;we are about to hear this year's Sorting Song.&quot;</p><p></p>
<p class="text-centre">............................................................</p>

A magical connection</h2>
<p>"Yes! 54 is the number - fantastic!" says Wally, beaming with delight.
</p><p>&quot;Our minds have a strong magical connection and I can see that you are truly a worthy wandholder, and deserving of my special 100% discount. I can also determine which wand will match you <em>exactly</em>.&quot;</p>
<p>Wally starts muttering to himself and he strides between the cabinets.</p>
<p>&quot;Flexible? Yes but not too much... The action will be important... More benign than malign that's for sure...&quot;</p>
<p>All of sudden Wally stops next to a cabinet and reaches inside.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes!&quot; he shouts and holds up a brown wand. &quot;This is the one, Arthur. Hold it!&quot;</p>
<p>You take it from his hand and it feels... right. Like it has always belonged to you - but that somehow <em>you</em> also belong to <em>the wand</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;An excellent match!&quot; says Wally &quot;Made of wood from the wishing tree, with a core of spider silk from the bottom of the great spider king himself, and curiously enough, one of my own beard hairs. Give it a wave Arthur.&quot;</p>
<p>You give the wand a bit of a shake. Effortlessly little sparks of gold zap off the end and ping into the walls. You feel magical power surge through your arm.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you very much Mr Wally&quot; says your Mum.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you Wally&quot; you say.</p>
<p>NO. THANK YOU! says Wally speaking directly into your mind. He looks at you and winks.</p>
<p>The only thing you are missing now is your spell book!</p><p></p>

All aboard</h2>
<p>You do as your Dad suggests, letting out a sigh as you tinkle in the toilet. You were so sure this was the right place. Evan sighs too and starts playing with the toilet brush.
</p><p>Curiously, as you wee in the toilet you notice that your urine is giving off a faint magical golden glow. Odd, you think, as you zip yourself up and press the flush...</p>
<p>...and leap backwards in surprise as the whole toilet and then the wall behind it disappears in a magical swirling spiral, leaving a perfectly round tunnel with steps heading deep down into the darkness. It is just like how the wall opened to get to Hippoto Mews, but this time it must have been activated by the magic sparkles in your wee!</p>
<p>&quot;This is the way!&quot; you shout, &quot;let's go!&quot;</p>
<p>The stairs go down and down for ages, but finally you see a brightly lit tunnel far below. Redoubling your efforts you bound down the remaining steps to find yourself in...</p>
<p>...a tiled white tunnel that looks very much like the tunnels you get in the London underground, except with strange magical sigils on the walls, emitting a warm golden light.</p>
<p>You run down the tunnel - it can't be long until the train leaves now! - and arrive at an underground station platform.</p>
<p>You see a tube train filled with children and a platform crowded with parents saying goodbye. You look up at the announcement board and read:</p>
<p>&quot;Hogsnorts: 1 minute&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Look Dad! The Hogsnorts Express is a tube train!&quot; you exclaim. &quot;And we're just in time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Goodbye Arthur,&quot; says your Dad &quot;Good luck in wizard school! Write to us as often as you can. We'll see you in six weeks when it's the holidays.&quot; There is a tear in his eye as he gives you a hug goodbye.</p>
<p>&quot;Bye bye Arthur,&quot; says Evan hugging your middle. &quot;Teach me a magic spell when you come back home.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I will Evan,&quot; you say. &quot;Goodbye and see you in a few weeks.&quot;</p>
<p>You spot the boy from the spellbook shop in one carriage, and in another the boy from the robe shop.</p>
<p>A piercing steam whistle shriek sounds from the front of the train.</p>
<p>&quot;Mind the doors please!&quot; a magically amplified voice calls out. &quot;Mind the closing doors!&quot;</p>

A spellbook puzzle</h2>
<p>You walk further into the book shop and spy a cheerful looking old witch wearing a black t-shirt with the word Watertomes on the back.
</p><p>&quot;Excuse me,&quot; you say &quot;Can you show me where the year 1 spellbook is?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Off to Hogsnorts are you young man?&quot; replies the old witch with a little cackle. &quot;Yes I can show you, follow me!&quot;</p>
<p>You and your mum follow the Watertomes witch as she shuffles off to the back of the bookshop. She picks up a heavy red book.</p>
<p>&quot;That will be 14 Frigates please.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah yes,&quot; replies your mum, &quot;We've only got pounds. Is that a problem?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well to tell the truth I don't really need money because I can magic up anything I like anyway. But I can't just give it to you for nothing... Tell you what, if you can solve my puzzle you can have it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What's the puzzle?&quot; you reply nervously, you never did like puzzles that much.</p>
<p>&quot;My lovely spell books are all about turning words into magic. And one of the magic things about words is that you can turn them into numbers.</p>
<p>For example the word CAB can turn into the number 6. C is the third letter of the alphabet, A is the first letter and B is the second. 3 + 1 + 2 = 6 so CAB turns into 6.</p>
<p>If you can magically turn my name into a number I will give you this book. My name is LIN. The old witch called Lin smiles at you encouragingly.</p>
<p>&quot;Hmmm let's see&quot; you say. As you are thinking the boy you saw at the front of the bookshop pushes a piece of paper into your hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Here!&quot; he says, &quot;this should help!&quot;</p>
<p>The piece of paper has all the letters of the alphabet next to their numbers:</p>
<p>A=1, B=2, C=3, E=4, D=5, F=6, G=7, H=8, I=9, J=10, K=11, L=12, M=13, N=14, O=15, P=16, Q=17, R=18, S=19, T=20, U=21, V=22, W=23, X=24, Y=25, Z=26</p><p></p>
<p class="text-centre">............................................................</p>

Magical mayhem</h2>
<p>You raise your wand, point it at the woodlice menacingly and shout loudly:
</p><p>&quot;Dispara dinosaurio demente!&quot;</p>
<p>From out of the end of your wand comes a faint but growing roaring sound, like an angry lion. The noise grows louder and louder until it is so loud it hurts your ears.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur, have you done?&quot; asks Kensley in alarm.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't...&quot; you begin, but before you can finish your sentence, a huge golden dinosaur head somehow <em>forces</em> it's way out of the tip of your wand, and roars again deafeningly.</p>
<p>&quot;ROAR!!!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh no, angry tyrannosaurus rexes are my number one fear!&quot; Kensley is too petrified to move.</p>
<p>But there's nothing you can do, the spell has been cast. The enormous magical t-rex squeezes its way out of your wand and charges its way towards the woodlice, waggling its ridiculous little front arms in a demented fashion.</p>
<p>It launches itself at the nearest woodlouse which has no time to react.</p>
<p>But instead of crushing the woodlouse in its banana sized teeth, the t-rex - impossibly - just bounces off.</p>
<p>It roars and tries again, with the same result.</p>
<p>Then it hits you - woodlice are completely immune to magic.</p>
<p>The dinosaur appears to understand this too. It looks around for a better target. And it's crazy little red eyes fix on you and Snako.</p>
<p>With a sense of horror you realise that the t-rex is now hunting <em>you</em>!</p>
<p>The rabid dinosaur leaps at you and Kensley but instead of eating you it flings you both into the stone wall on each side and you bump your head painfully. The t-rex stomps up the corridor before disappearing a puff of gold stars as the magic wears off.</p>
<p>As you slide down the wall and into unconsciousness, you can see the millions of woodlice waving their little antennae. As you close your eyes you think: are they laughing?</p><p></p>

A visit to Spellwitches</h2>
<p>You may have your spell book but you need to look like a wizard too.
</p><p>The shop has large storefront windows. Inside the windows manikins have been arranged wearing black witch and wizard robes. The manikins are in a variety of action poses, such as just about to cast a spell, or frozen running away from a dragon.</p>
<p>But they have clearly been magically enchanted because every now and again one of the manikins will change their position to something else, moving smoothly with astonishing realism. You look at the manikins carefully - they really are amazingly life-like, even down to the expressions of surprise on their faces.</p>
<p>You and your mum make a little bell dingle as you push open the door.</p>
<p>In front of you are racks and racks of wizard robes, all black. Above some racks a sign says 'small', above others it says 'medium', and others 'large'.</p>
<p>Shelves cover the walls and the shelves are covered in pointy black hats.</p>
<p>&quot;May I help you at all?&quot;</p>
<p>You and your mum both jump - a witch with a totally green face leaps out from behind a rack of black robes just in front of you.</p>
<p>&quot;Just browsing are you?&quot;</p>
<p>You jump again as another witch, looking identical to the first, pops out from a rack of clothes behind you.</p>
<p>&quot;Aargh!&quot; you exclaim. You take a breath and calm yourself and clear your throat.</p>
<p>&quot;Robes?&quot; you squeak &quot;For Hogsnorts?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are in the right place my little dear&quot; said green witch number 1. &quot;Let's see how you measure up!&quot;</p>
<p>The two witches take you to a side room where a magic tape measure is already taking the measurements of a pale looking boy about your age.</p>
<p>The boy looks at you with an expression that could either be a sneer or a smile, you can't quite be sure.</p>

Picked for Hogggers</h2>
<p>Hedgehog House! I want to be in Hedgehog House.
</p><p>Coo coo are you sure it's Hedgehog House? asks Percy the pigeon, speaking directly into your mind now.</p>
<p>Yes please, you think back at him. Not a slimey Snakefang, not a meathead Lionpaw, not a smarty pants Ravenclaw. I don't want any trouble, I just want to be in Hedgehog House!</p>
<p>Coo coo as you wish young Arthur, speaks Percy into your brain.</p>
<p>Slowly the great yellow eyes shrink to normal size and you are just staring at a regular giant talking pigeon again.</p>
<p>Percy waddles over to the centre of the hole where the light from the hall shines down. He looks old and you wonder how long he has been doing this. For decades? Centuries even?</p>
<p>The giant pigeon settles down on the floor, and coos once or twice. He then stands up slowly and waddles back into the darkness at the edge of the hole that is his home. On the floor he has laid a large and beautiful egg.</p>
<p>The egg is a dull brown colour stripes. The colour of Hedgehog House!</p>
<p>Your heart pounding with excitement, you pick up the egg and slowly walk back up the wooden stairs to the noise and light of the Hogsnorts Great Hall.</p>
<p>As you emerge out of the pigeon hole, Slumblebore sees your egg and shouts: &quot;Arthur Otley, Hedgehog House!&quot;</p><p></p>

The sorting song</h2>
<p>A warbling tune floats into the hall from the hole: 
</p><div class="text-poem">
<p>&quot;<em>First years, first years, what will you do?<br>
Which House do you like and which House likes you?<br>
I've written this ditty while waiting in my hole<br>
Listen very closely and figure out your role...</em></p>
<p><em>Leonard Lionpaw he fights for truth<br>
With boot and fist, nail and tooth.<br>
When injustice triumphs it makes him sick<br>
He'll fight right back with a punch and a kick.</em></p>
<p><em>Rebecca Ravenwing, her mind's so quick,<br>
She makes even Albert Einstein look a bit thick.<br>
When evil lurks she knows just what to do:<br>
Outwit the wicked witch with her brainbox crew.</em></p>

She'll never start trouble or cause you harm.<br>
With bad magic in the air, she'll act fast:<br>
She'll hide and curl up until the danger is past.</em></p>
<p><em>Sylvester Snakefang, seeking world domination<br>
Power is his thing along with extirpation.<br>
When darkness comes his eyes light up,<br>
He'll do anything it takes to make it to the top.</em>&quot;</p>
</div>
<p>The song warbles to a stop and there is smattering of polite applause from the children in the hall.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you Percy,&quot; says Slumblebore, directing his voice down into the hole. &quot;Although I must say I thought last year's song was better.&quot;</p>
<p>Percy? What is this strange singing creature called Percy living in a hole underneath the Great Hall? you ask yourself.</p>
<p>&quot;First years, please form a queue in front of me!&quot;</p>

On the Hogsnorts Express</h2>
<p>The boy in the bookshop seemed friendly so you decide to go and sit next to him. Your mind made up, you leap aboard the train just as the doors slam shut behind you.
</p><p>&quot;Hello,&quot; you say, &quot;I'm Arthur, we saw each other in the spellbook shop in Hippoto Mews the other day.&quot;</p>
<p>You sit down in the spare seat next to him. He glances up from the spell book he is reading.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello, I'm Daniel,&quot; he says then carries on reading his book and muttering to himself.</p>
<p>&quot;What's that book you're reading?&quot; you ask.</p>
<p>&quot;Das Magical, by Lotso Larks. It's a collection of spells for coordinating large groups of people.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh&quot; you reply. &quot;Would you like a Smarty?&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel's eyes light up and he puts the book down. &quot;I love Smarties. Have you got any purple ones?&quot;</p>
<p>You share out the colourful chocolate treats companionably. Your favourite ones are blue ones which makes Daniel excited.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey Arthur,&quot; he begins, &quot;did you know that blue and copper are the colours of Ravenwing House? You like blue Smarties, maybe that's a sign that you will be in Ravenwing House like I will be?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah maybe,&quot; you say &quot;Ravenwing is for brain-boxes people right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's the house for people that love learning. What would life be like if you never learned new things? I want to find out as much as possible. I want to know the secret of teleportation, of space travel, of unlimited energy. I want to know everything! Don't you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I guess I would&quot; you reply although... that sounds like a lot of studying and even then you might not end up knowing <em>everything</em>.</p>
<p>While you are talking to Daniel the train chugs out from the dark tunnel into daylight, as the railway tracks emerge from the side of a hill.</p>
<p>You twist in your seat to peer out of the window. As far as you can see there are rolling hills covered in pine trees. In the distance, craggy mountains emerge, their tops clouded in mist. It looks like nowhere you have ever seen before, except perhaps in the illustrations to one of your favourite books, The Hobbit.</p>
<p>You feel like you have entered a magical new land and your adventure has truly begun.</p>
<p>A magically amplified voice interrupts your daydreams of dwarves and dragons, trolls and treasure.</p>
<p>&quot;Train terminates here. All change please, all change. Mind the gap.&quot;</p>

 Snako Malboy</h2>
<p>"Hello," you say to the boy "my name's Arthur Otley and I'm going to Hogsnorts. Who are you?"
</p><p>The boy does his sneering smile at you again.</p>
<p>&quot;Snako Malboy. Yes I too am going to Hogsnorts. My father went to Hogsnorts. My grandfather went to Hogsnorts. So did his father and so on up to 72 generations and the founding of the school. Sylvester Snake - yes <em>the</em> Sylvester Snake is my direct ancestor. And my mother and their mothers too. So yes I am going to Hogsnorts.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who is Sylvester Snake?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sylvester Snake is only the founder of Snake House! The best house in the school. I'm going to be in Snake House. Snake House is for the really powerful wizards, like I will be one day. You will be in Hedgehog House I suppose.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I haven't decided yet&quot; you reply.</p>
<p>&quot;Well if you want to be Snake House like me you have to be strong and ruthless. Snake House rules yah sssssssss!&quot;</p>
<p>Snako Malboy sticks his tongue in and out of his mouth like a snake and hisses - not an easy thing to do at the same time. You are impressed.</p>

</p><p>&quot;Our minds have a strong magical connection and I can see that you are truly a worthy wandholder, and deserving of my special 100% discount. I can also determine which wand will match you <em>exactly</em>.&quot;</p>
<p>Wally starts muttering to himself and he strides between the cabinets.</p>
<p>&quot;Flexible? Yes but not too much... The action will be important... More benign than malign that's for sure...&quot;</p>
<p>All of sudden Wally stops next to a cabinet and reaches inside.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes!&quot; he shouts and holds up a brown wand. &quot;This is the one, Arthur. Hold it!&quot;</p>
<p>You take it from his hand and it feels... right. Like it has always belonged to you - but that somehow <em>you</em> also belong to <em>the wand</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;An excellent match!&quot; says Wally &quot;Made of wood from the wishing tree, with a core of spider silk from the bottom of the great spider king himself, and curiously enough, one of my own beard hairs. Give it a wave Arthur.&quot;</p>
<p>You give the wand a bit of a shake. Effortlessly little sparks of gold zap off the end and ping into the walls. You feel magical power surge through your arm.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you very much Mr Wally&quot; says your Mum.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you Wally&quot; you say.</p>
<p>NO. THANK YOU! says Wally speaking directly into your mind. He looks at you and winks.</p>
<p>Now you have your robes, your spell book and your wand, it is time to get to Hogsnorts!</p><p></p>

Wanderful Wands</h2>
<p>You decide to visit Wally's Wanderful Wands shop first. You want to get your hands on a wand as soon as possible and start doing some magic.
</p><p>The sign above Wally's shop is a giant wand dangling from a chain above the shop door. It swings gently to and fro even though there is no breeze to speak of, and little crackles of electric-gold magic arc over its surface.</p>
<p>You can't help thinking that this wand must also double up as Wally's security system.</p>
<p>With a nervous glance upwards you and your Mum enter the shop.</p>
<p>The inside is sparklingly clean and glass cabinets are artfully arranged around the shop. Each cabinet contains three or four magic wands, resting on little red cushions with gold tassles. It all looks <em>very</em> expensive.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur are you sure this is the only wand shop?&quot; asks your mum. &quot;Perhaps there is another one that is not quite so err... so un...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Welcome!&quot; a smooth rich voice startles them from the back of the room. &quot;Welcome to Wally's Wanderful Wand shop! And madam I can assure you that this is the only wand shop in Hippoto Mews. But fear not I'm sure we can find a wand that is the perfect match for young Arthur.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How did you know my name?&quot; you ask in surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the many branches of magic in which I am an expert, young Arthur is mind reading. Just by looking into your eyes I can see the entire contents of your brain. I can also do it by looking in your ears, in your mouth, up your nose... any hole works to tell the truth. But I usually prefer the eyes. Also your Mum called you Arthur when you entered my shop.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you are Wally I suppose?&quot; says your Mum.</p>
<p>&quot;I am indeed, dear madam. Did you divine this from looking in my ear hole? Remarkable!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No I figured it out when you said this was your shop.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Quite so. We are all mind-readers to some degree.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Wally&quot; you interrupt &quot;can I have a wand please?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No you cannot have <em>a</em> wand Arthur. But what you can have is <em>the</em> wand. Every wand is unique! You are unique! You require the exact match for your particular thaumaturgical resonance. Your thaumaturgic twin as it were. The most powerful - the only! - tool you will ever need as a magician.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That sounds nice,&quot; says your Mum, &quot;but we don't want anything <em>too</em> fancy. Or expensive.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The wand is of course priceless. But you can buy one for 100 Golden Frigates.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Golden what now?&quot; asks your Mum. &quot;Don't you take pounds? I don't have any Golden Frigates.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's wizard money only in this shop I'm afraid. I do offer a 10% discount for Hogsnorts' students in their first year... But for you I will increase this discount to 100% if - if! - Arthur and I can establish a true connection of minds, and I can see that you Arthur are a worthy wandholder.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A 100% discount you say? That's a good deal. Arthur see if you can connect up your mind with Wally's love.&quot; your Mum suggests.</p>
<p>Wally crouches down in front of you and holds your ears gently but firmly forcing you to look deep into his blue grey eyes. At first nothing happens. But after just a few moments you get the strange sensation of being <em>pulled</em>  towards his eyeballs; his black pupils feel like they are <em>dragging</em> you inwards.</p>
<p>&quot;Good Arthur, very good!&quot; says Wally. &quot;I believe that the magical connection between our minds is now established, and astonishingly quickly too! You must have deep reserves of magic.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur I need you to think of a number. If I can read your mind and tell you the number you were thinking of this will be proof that the magical mind connection is working properly.</p>
<p>&quot;First I need you to think of a number between 1 and 10. But don't tell me what it is! Have you got one?&quot;</p>
<p>You think of a number and nod your head.</p>
<p>&quot;Now&quot; says Wally, &quot;I need you to multiply this number by 9. 9 is a number with strong magical properties&quot; he explains.</p>
<p>You multiply your number by 9.</p>
<p>&quot;The next step&quot; he says, &quot;is to split your answer into the two digits and add those two digits together. For example if your answer is 13 (and I know it is not!) then you would split it into 1 and 3, then add that 1 and 3 together, so 1 + 3 = 4.</p>
<p>&quot;Ok&quot; you say as you do the sum in your head.</p>
<p>&quot;Now take that answer and multiply it by 8. Can you do that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes&quot; you reply.</p>
<p>&quot;Now turn to that number! And we will see if our minds are connected.&quot;</p><p></p>

A spellbook puzzle</h2>
<p>You walk further into the book shop and spy a cheerful looking old witch wearing a black t-shirt with the word Watertomes on the back.
</p><p>&quot;Excuse me,&quot; you say &quot;Can you show me where the year 1 spellbook is?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Off to Hogsnorts are you young man?&quot; replies the old witch with a little cackle. &quot;Yes I can show you, follow me!&quot;</p>
<p>You and your mum follow the Watertomes witch as she shuffles off to the back of the bookshop. She picks up a heavy red book.</p>
<p>&quot;That will be 14 Frigates please.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah yes,&quot; replies your mum, &quot;We've only got pounds. Is that a problem?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well to tell the truth I don't really need money because I can magic up anything I like anyway. But I can't just give it to you for nothing... Tell you what, if you can solve my puzzle you can have it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What's the puzzle?&quot; you reply nervously, you never did like puzzles that much.</p>
<p>&quot;My lovely spell books are all about turning words into magic. And one of the magic things about words is that you can turn them into numbers.</p>
<p>For example the word CAB can turn into the number 6. C is the third letter of the alphabet, A is the first letter and B is the second. 3 + 1 + 2 = 6 so CAB turns into 6.</p>
<p>If you can magically turn my name into a number I will give you this book. My name is SUE. The old witch called Sue smiles at you encouragingly.</p>
<p>&quot;Hmmm let's see&quot; you say. As you are thinking the boy you saw at the front of the bookshop pushes a piece of paper into your hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Here!&quot; he says, &quot;this should help!&quot;</p>
<p>The piece of paper has all the letters of the alphabet next to their numbers:</p>
<p>A=1, B=2, C=3, E=4, D=5, F=6, G=7, H=8, I=9, J=10, K=11, L=12, M=13, N=14, O=15, P=16, Q=17, R=18, S=19, T=20, U=21, V=22, W=23, X=24, Y=25, Z=26</p><p></p>

The Winged Monkeys</h2>
<p>You step off the train with the other children, onto a platform that looks like something from the Victorian era a hundred years ago. There is steam coming from the train chimney, old fashioned signs saying Hogsnorts Station, a row of gargoyles on the station roof, and a lingering smell of pipe smoke.
</p><p>You are momentarily distracted by the sight of something else stepping out, or more accurately climbing out of the train: hundreds of spiders filing out of the doors and onto the platform. How curious, you think.</p>
<p>&quot;All students over here!&quot; a deafening bellow startles you so much that you forget about the spiders. &quot;Follow me!&quot;</p>
<p>Through the crowds of children dressed up as miniature witches and wizards strides an impossibly large man. His enormous bristling black beard and thick bushy hair make his twinkling eyes and bulbous nose look like the epicentre of a hair explosion.</p>
<p>&quot;Now then students!&quot; says the giant, his tummy wobbling as he bellows. &quot;Space yourselves out a bit and raise both arms in the air.&quot;</p>
<p>You and the other first years eye each other uneasily.</p>
<p>&quot;Monkeys!&quot; yells the giant man into the sky.</p>
<p>At first nothing happens and you wonder if the giant isn't just a total madman who likes to hang out in train stations. But then... you hear lots of faint cracking sounds and look up to see the gargoyles on the station roof <em>come to life</em>.</p>
<p>Your jaw drops as the stone statues transform into flesh, blood and fur monkeys, each with a pair of feathered wings and, for some reason, a little red hat.</p>
<p>&quot;Two flying monkeys to a child!&quot; shouts out the fat giant. The monkeys - or are they actually some species of chimpanzee? - chatter and grimace to show they understand, then jump down to the station platform and scamper up to the children.</p>
<p>Two winged monkeys, both about the same size as you are, grab you underneath one arm each, scream and bare their teeth in excitement and launch themselves into the sky.</p>
<p>You decide to:</p><p></p>

On the Hogsnorts Express</h2>
<p>You leap nimbly into the carriage with the boy from the robe shop - it will be fun to chat on the journey. You go and sit next to him.
</p><p>&quot;Hello,&quot; you say &quot;I'm Arthur, we saw each other in the robe shop.&quot;</p>
<p>The boy does his sneer-smile. &quot;Yes I know, you're the boy who didn't have any wizard money. I'm Snako Malboy, the richest boy in the school, so why should I talk to you?&quot;</p>
<p>You decide to change your approach.</p>
<p>&quot;I've got some Smarties, would you like one?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Smarties?&quot; replies Snako, &quot;what are you, some kind of smarty pants?&quot; He snorts with laughter and looks round the carriage to see if anyone is laughing at his rubbish joke. No-one reacts.</p>
<p>Sitting back in his seat Snako adds more quietly: &quot;Yes please, have you got any blue ones? They're my favourite.&quot;</p>
<p>For the next few minutes you happily share out the colourful chocolate treats. Snako likes the blue ones and your favourite are the green, which makes him excited.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey Arthur, did you know Snakefang House colours are green and silver? And you like green Smarties. Maybe that's a sign that you will be in Snakefang House too, like I will be!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What's Snakefang House like?&quot; you ask curiously.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh it's great,&quot; replies Snako. &quot;All the most powerful wizards have been in Snakefang House. It teaches you how to make other people do what you want.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not sure I want to make people do stuff&quot; you say.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you want to change the world when you grow up? I know I do. I don't want to just put up with how things are. And how are you going to change the world if everyone just ignores you? We can make them <em>listen</em> Arthur, then you can have all the green Smarties you want.&quot;</p>
<p>It's a good argument - you would like to have more green Smarties. You promise Snako to think about it and sit in companionable silence as the train chuffs onwards through a dark tunnel.</p>
<p>After what seems absolutely ages the Hogsnorts Express bursts into daylight, the train tracks emerging from the mouth of the tunnel in the side of a hill.</p>
<p>You twist in your seat to peer out of the window. As far as you can see there are rolling hills covered in pine trees. In the distance, craggy mountains emerge, their tops clouded in mist. It looks like nowhere you have ever seen before, except perhaps in the illustrations to one of your favourite books, The Hobbit.</p>
<p>You feel like you have entered a magical new land and your adventure has truly begun.</p>
<p>A magically amplified voice interrupts your daydreams of dwarves and dragons, trolls and treasure.</p>
<p>&quot;Train terminates here. All change please, all change. Mind the gap.&quot;</p>
<p>Hogsnorts station!  This is it. You've arrived.</p><p></p>

Back on the street</h2>
<p>Back on Hippoto Mews, the crowds of witches and wizards seem even thicker.
</p><p>When a small child magician walks past because the pointy end of their hat is about the same height as your face and when one of them turns round quickly, it could easily poke your eye out if you are not careful.</p>
<p>But this doesn't really bother you, it's so exciting to be around real magicians!</p>

A spellbook puzzle</h2>
<p>You walk further into the book shop and spy a cheerful looking old witch wearing a black t-shirt with the word Watertomes on the back in white letters.
</p><p>&quot;Excuse me,&quot; you say &quot;Can you show me where the year 1 spellbook is?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That will be 14 Frigates please.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;14 Frigates?&quot; replies your mum, &quot;Don't you take pounds?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wizard money only I'm afraid, but...&quot; the old lady tails off.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes?&quot; you say.</p>
<p>&quot;Well to tell the truth I don't really need money because I can magic up anything I like anyway. But I can't just give it to you for nothing... Tell you what, if you can solve my puzzle you can have it.&quot;</p>

Spelling trouble</h2>
<p>"I know I am called Arthur Otley," you say. "But is my name who I really am?"
</p><p>&quot;Excellent point Arthur! I can see by your question that you are already on the path to enlightenment. Because it is only when we realise that we <em>don't</em> know everything that we can learn.&quot;</p>
<p>Madame Blavatsky smiles at you. &quot;And because you are ready to learn I will now teach you your first spell.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But first can anyone tell me,&quot; she says addressing the whole class now, &quot;what is the most common cause of death for wizards and witches? Anyone?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Fighting dragons?&quot; suggests Snako.</p>
<p>&quot;Zombies?&quot; proposes another child.</p>
<p>&quot;Soul suckers? Werewolves? Vampires?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, no and no again.&quot; replies Professor Blavatsky. &quot;The one thing that is most likely to kill you more than anything else is: each other.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Let me explain. Imagine it is night time, 3am in the morning. You hear a noise downstairs. Immediately you are on the alert. It could be burglars. Or more likely dark wizards on the attack. You creep downstairs, wand at the ready. You can hear them rummaging around in the kitchen. You leap out shouting the most deadly spells you can think of. Only to discover... it is your Uncle Brian who is visiting for the weekend and has come down in the night to help himself to a biscuit. Now he is paralysed on the kitchen floor, a look of horror on his face and the packet of biscuits grasped so tightly in his hand that no-one else will be eating them ever again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes I'm afraid to say that the most common cause of death is 'friendly fire', accidentally hitting your friends and family with dangerous or deadly spells. The sad fact is that you are all in far more danger from each other than from any evil sorcerer. Which is why the spell I am going to teach you to protect against dark magic is a sleeping spell. It is one I designed myself. The benefit of this spell is that it is completely reversible. To wake someone up, you just need to tickle them under their armpits.&quot;</p>
<p>Blavatsky then whips out her wand and points it at Snako.</p>
<p>&quot;Somnolencia salchicha sabrosa!&quot; she screams.</p>
<p>A dart of pure golden light shoots out of the end of her wand and hits Snako right in the middle of his forehead. In less than a half a second his head has sunk down to his arms on his desk and he is snoring like a sailor.</p>
<p>The class breaks out into a round of applause.</p>
<p>&quot;Make sure you get the pronunciation just right when you cast the spell&quot; Blavatksy advises as she walks over to Snako and tickles him under the armpits.</p>
<p>&quot;He he he! What happened?&quot; says Snako, confused.</p>
<p>The class splits into pairs and you practice sending each other to sleep. Because Snako is still a bit drowsy you go first, pointing your wand at his forehead just as the teacher did:</p>
<p>&quot;Somnolencia salchicha sabrosa...&quot; you repeat carefully.</p>
<p>You feel a wonderful feeling of magical power gathering in your tummy. In an instant it has whooshed up out of your arm, channelled by the wand into a golden dart that zaps Snako on the head, for the second time in as many minutes.</p>
<p>In no time at all he is asleep and snoring again.</p>
<p>&quot;I did it!&quot; you shout. &quot;The magic spell worked!&quot;</p>
<p>Delighted with your success you tickle Snako under the armpits. As he wakes up giggling you try hard to memorise the spell 'Somnolencia salchicha sabrosa' - you never know when it may come in handy.</p><p></p>

<p>&quot;Flexible? Yes but not too much... The action will be important... More benign than malign that's for sure...&quot;</p>
<p>All of sudden Wally stops next to a cabinet and reaches inside.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes!&quot; he shouts and holds up a brown wand. &quot;This is the one, Arthur. Hold it!&quot;</p>

</p><p>The golden glow shining all around you gets stronger and stronger and soon you have to shut your eyes to the blinding golden light.</p>

<p>Opening your eyes you find you are at the bottom of a great stone well, with a circle of light far above. You realise that you have magically transported back to Percy the Picking Pigeon's hole in the Hogsnort's Great Hall, just as Slumblebore said you would. Somehow you know that you have also travelled back in time to before, when you had just arrived at the school. You are that Arthur once again in Percy's hole, but this time you can make a new choice.</p>

The final decision</h2>
<p>"What did you do that for?" you cry. "I thought he was your friend!"
</p><p>&quot;Eric Knid is... weak,&quot; replies Azog. &quot;His only purpose was to help me lure the chosen one - you - down here. Now that you have arrived, I no longer need him.&quot;</p>
<p>Azog stepped delicately over the snoring form of Professor Knid and advances towards you.</p>
<p>&quot;Just think Arthur. Together we could achieve so much. You, the chosen one with your one-of-a-kind wand and me with all the armies of the arthropods at my command! We could do anything. We could do everything!&quot;</p>
<p>While Azog is talking he is getting steadily closer and closer to you. You find yourself mesmerised by his eight tiny compound eyes.</p>
<p>Perhaps you <em>should</em> take a stand, remake the world with Azog and the insect hordes, take over the school... on the other hand if you were to stop Azog now you would be a hero and would surely win the house cup for Lionpaw.</p>

Inner peace</h2>
<p>"I'm Arthur Otley and I want to learn some spells" you say to Professor Blavatsky.
</p><p>&quot;Ah so impatient. And yet this impatience stops you learning about yourself. I can see that you are very far from self control as yet.&quot;</p>
<p>The teacher stands up and raises one hand.</p>
<p>&quot;But do not worry, any of you. Because we will start with a simple meditation session to help you gain control.&quot;</p>
<p>You groan inwardly. This sounds boring.</p>
<p>&quot;Close your eyes everyone,&quot; begins Professor Blavatsky. &quot;Make sure you are comfortable in your seats. Now I want you to focus on your breathing. Breathe in. Breathe out. Breathe in... and breathe out.</p>
<p>&quot;Feel the breath flowing into your nostrils. Concentrate on the sensation. Do you feel your nose hairs tickling? Perhaps a small bogey flapping around in your nasal passage? Just think about the breath, how it feels.&quot;</p>
<p>Despite yourself you feel your awareness sharpening, and you do indeed feel a small bogey in your nostril wobbling around as you breathe in and out.</p>
<p>&quot;Now I want you to think about a special number. The special number is 42. A four and then a two. Forty two. This number is not just a number it is also a place. A location. A place of calm that you can always turn to in moments of difficulty or stress.</p>
<p>&quot;This number 42 is a place within yourself, but it is a real place too that anyone can reach, if they just turn to that number... the number 42. As you turn to 42, just keep your thumb here so you know where to come back to.&quot;</p>
<p>Amazingly you feel a sensation as if you are floating somehow, except with your thumb stuck down in front of you. Concentrating fiercely you try with all your might to turn to 42. You float away...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&quot;Did anyone manage to meditate and reach 42?&quot; asks Madam Blavatsky.</p>
<p>You definitely feel you went... somewhere. You <em>think</em> this is what Professor Blavatsky meant.</p>
<p>&quot;Any time you find yourself in need of quiet and peace, just repeat this meditation exercise and think of the number 42 and you will find a place of calm and relaxation - but keep your thumb right where you are and you will be able to turn back whenever you want.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Class dismissed! We will meet again.&quot;</p><p></p>

<p>Looking round you, you can see that you are at the junction of a number of stone corridors.
</p><p>One passageway has a sign above it saying &quot;Slumblebore's office this way&quot;.</p>
<p>Another one appears to lead downwards with a gentle slope.</p>
<p>A spiral staircase climbs up from another doorway. A little sign with an arrow reads: &quot;Your heart's desire's desire.&quot;</p>

Battle rage</h2>
<p>"Die beetles, die!" you cry, running towards the three giant bombardier beetles. 
</p><p>In your battle rage you forget all about magic and your wand, you just want to reach the beetles and grapple them with your bare hands, mano a beetlo.</p>
<p>&quot;Yaaaah!&quot; you cry most uncharacteristically, closing the distance fast...</p>
<p>...but not fast enough. The three beetles swiftly raise up their bottoms, and shoot out three streams of superheated acid, accompanied by three loud popping sounds.</p>
<p>One stream misses your head by inches, another strikes the wall beside you, the third the floor in front.</p>
<p>&quot;Ha! You missed me! You'll have to get up earlier in the morning than that to...&quot;</p>
<p>But you never get the chance to tell them what they will have to do when they get up early in the morning, because at that moment your foot slips on the pool of acid on the floor and slides out from underneath you. You fly through the air very briefly before slamming into the floor, bumping your head hard enough to knock you out cold.</p><p></p>

Professor Eric Knid Explains</h2>
<p>A voice, strong and commanding, emerges from the darkness. "You? The saviour, a mere stripling first year? Impossible!"  
</p><p>Another voice, high pitched and chittery, answers him. &quot;Yes Eric, this is him. He is the wand holder.&quot;</p>
<p>As your eyes adjust to the gloom, you can make out a figure standing in the centre of the room. A wizard - and someone you recognise.</p>
<p>&quot;Professor Knid!&quot; you exclaim.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes Professor Eric Knid at your service! Or perhaps I should say that you will be at my service... Arthur isn't it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes my name's Arthur. Arthur Otley.&quot; A sensation of fear congeals in your throat. &quot;What do you mean? And who were you talking to just now?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All in good time, Arthur...&quot; with an unexpectedly swift movement Professor Knid draws his wand and shoots a spell of locking at the iron gate which clangs shut.</p>
<p>You are trapped.</p>
<p>&quot;What are you going to do?&quot;</p>
<p>Eric Knid smiled. Even in the dark you can see the mad gleam in his eye: &quot;Revolution!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Explain why Eric.&quot; That chittering voice again, appearing out of nowhere.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes - why. Why?&quot; Professor Knid takes a deep breath. &quot;Ever since I was a young boy Arthur I have felt an affinity with insects, spiders, crabs. With the Arthropods. A dog will bite you, not so an earwig! A lion may eat you, not so a woodlouse! A human may betray you, a spider will not.</p>
<p>&quot;My faithful friends growing up were slugs, ants, flies and beetles. But my friends were mercilessly crushed, poisoned, and swatted by humans.</p>
<p>&quot;The final straw? Slumblebore sat on a spider - and laughed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I couldn't bear it. I sought out the Great Spider King Azog himself. What joy when I found him in the forbidden bushes and entered his service. Together we have been gathering supporters here in this dungeon, insects and spiders in their millions. For revenge. For a revolution. To take over the school!</p>
<p>&quot;No longer will it just be Lionpaw House, Ravenwing House, Snakefang House, and Hedgehog House! We will have a new house mightier than all of them. The Order of the Arthropods! And I will be headmaster.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But why me?&quot; fear chills you. &quot;What has this got to with me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are the only one who can stop us Arthur,&quot; says the mysterious high pitched voice. &quot;But with you on our side we will be invincible!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who is that?&quot; you cry.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the Great Spider King Azog himself. And you are honoured to stand in his presence.&quot; Professor Knid explains.</p>
<p>&quot;Where?&quot; You can't see anyone other than the Professor.</p>
<p>&quot;Here!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where, I can't see!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right here, look! Closer!&quot;</p><p></p>

Jape&#39;s joke time</h2>
<p>You raise your hand and most of the other children do the same. 
</p><p>&quot;Brilliant!&quot; says Professor Jape, &quot;How about this one.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Knock knock!&quot; says Jape.
&quot;Who's there?&quot; you all reply.
&quot;Eye needap.&quot;
&quot;Eye needap who?&quot;
&quot;Well come on in and use the toilet!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's quite a good one!&quot; you whisper to Aaron.</p>
<p>&quot;Ok children, next one:</p>
<p>&quot;Why did the Ravenwing student go to the Hogsnorts dining room? Come on, any guesses? No?</p>
<p>&quot;To eat. To eat. D'you get it? You know: Ravenwing, like a bird. To eat: tweet. Oh you lot are hopeless. Right next one.</p>
<p>&quot;What do you call a naked Spanish man on the beach?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Any ideas?&quot; shouts out Professor Jape thoroughly enjoying himself now. &quot;No? You call him Señor Willy.&quot;</p>
<p>A few groans and shouts of laughter in the room.</p>
<p>&quot;What about a hippo with only one leg? A hoppo!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right, listen to this.&quot; Jape continues. &quot;There was a farmer taking his cow to market to sell. The trouble is that this cow is very old and very slow. So slow in fact that the farmer is worried they might not get to market before it closes for the day. Anyway they come across an old man sitting by the side of the road. 'That cow looks like he's on his last legs' says the old man, and he hands the farmer two red pills. 'Now,' says the old man, 'If you stick one of these red pills up the cow's bottom he will be as right as rain.' Well the farmer sticks one of the red pills up the cow's bottom. The cow twitches three times and then he's off! He runs down the road towards the market as fast as a race horse. 'That's amazing!' says the farmer, 'Thanks a million for the pills. But what I don't understand is: why did you give me two pills?' 'Well,' says the old man, 'you want to catch him don't you?'</p>
<p>Professor Jape bursts into uncontrollable high pitched giggling and lots of the other children laugh too.</p>
<p>&quot;Right children,&quot; says Jape. &quot;That's all we've got time for in this lesson. I hope you had a good laugh, I know I did. See you next time.&quot;</p><p></p>

Dinner time</h2>
<p>Joining a file of other Ravenwing students you head off on the long winding route back to the Hogsnorts Great Hall to get your dinner.
</p><p>You take a seat at the Ravenwing table and look around you, flabbergasted.</p>
<p>Tonight Slumblebore has enchanted the walls and ceiling of the Great Hall to look like the whole hall is itself placed upon another table, as big as a parade ground, with great giants at either side ready to eat. An image of a candlestick towers above you and the ceiling in this giants’ dining hall is far above that. The enchantment is unbelievably realistic.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't forget to eat Arthur!&quot; Daniel reminds you, with a grin.</p>
<p>You look down to see yet another incredible feast.</p>
<p>Huge succulent poached salmon lie head to tail down the table, each one laid to rest in a solid silver tureen. Small mountains of roasted new potatoes, studded with salt crystals and veined with melted butter. Steamed broccoli the size of small trees, standing upright and giving off a wonderful green fresh aroma. Piles of chestnuts, slathered with marmalade and honey. Cunningly artificed marzipan animals, generously daubed in tomato ketchup.</p>
<p>It is all so delicious you can't stop an involuntary slobber which you quickly wipe from your chin with the table cloth.</p>
<p>You cram food into your mouth and gulp it down.</p>
<p>You are just gobbling up your eleventh marmalade and honey coated chestnut, when all of a sudden Slumblebore's enchanted imagery on the walls shows one of the giants <em>reaching</em> for the students in the hall: a colossal hand outstretched.</p>
<p>You scream and shout with the other students - Slumblebore's enchantment looks so real - when the hand appears to pick up the Hogsnorts Hall and carry it to his mouth!</p>
<p>Chairs are leaning crazily as the simulation progresses to show the inside of the giant's mouth as he chomps and swallows the hall. It looks as if you are falling, falling down the giant's throat, into his stomach. There are cries of dismay from some of the other younger students who have to be reassured that it is all just an amazing illusion.</p>
<p>As you continue your own meal, the simulation shows you pass through the giant's stomach, into the small intestine, then the large intensive until finally you emerge with a plop and drop into a bucket.</p>
<p>The students break into wild applause - this is one of Slumblebore's best ceiling enchantments yet!</p>
<p>&quot;Bravo, bravo!&quot; shouts Daniel Colliers-Wood, &quot;Now I know how this chestnut feels, ha ha! Bravo!&quot;</p>
<p>This signals the end of the best dinner you have ever had.</p>

A magical connection</h2>
<p>"Yes! 81 is the number - fantastic!" says Wally, beaming with delight.
</p><p>&quot;Our minds have a strong magical connection and I can see that you are truly a worthy wandholder, and deserving of my special 100% discount. I can also determine which wand will match you <em>exactly</em>.&quot;</p>
<p>Wally starts muttering to himself and he strides between the cabinets.</p>
<p>&quot;Flexible? Yes but not too much... The action will be important... More benign than malign that's for sure...&quot;</p>
<p>All of sudden Wally stops next to a cabinet and reaches inside.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes!&quot; he shouts and holds up a brown wand. &quot;This is the one, Arthur. Hold it!&quot;</p>
<p>You take it from his hand and it feels... right. Like it has always belonged to you - but that somehow <em>you</em> also belong to <em>the wand</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;An excellent match!&quot; says Wally &quot;Made of wood from the heart of the wishing tree, with a core of spider silk from the bottom of the great spider king himself, and curiously enough, one of my own beard hairs. Give it a wave Arthur.&quot;</p>
<p>You give the wand a bit of a shake. Effortlessly little sparks of gold zap off the end and ping into the walls. You feel magical power surge through your arm.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you very much Mr Wally&quot; says your Mum.</p>

Epilogue</h2>
<p>The next day all the children are called to the school hall for a special announcement.
</p><p>As you take your seats at the house tables you notice that the ceiling has been enchanted to a beautiful sky blue with fluffy clouds scudding past on one side and a flock of pterosaurs fighting to the death on the other.</p>
<p>&quot;Students,&quot; announces Slumblebore from the front of the hall. &quot;I have a very special announcement. Yesterday, unbeknownst to us, we were threatened by a vast and evil insect horde gathering in the school dungeon.&quot;</p>
<p>Slumblebore casts a severe glance at professor Knid, who looks down sheepishly at the table.</p>
<p>&quot;We were saved thanks to the bravery, resourcefulness and gumption of one boy.</p>
<p>&quot;That boy is Arthur Otley.&quot;</p>
<p>You feel your cheeks go red as all the students in the school turn round to get a look at you and you hear whispers of &quot;yes that's him&quot;, &quot;defeated the insects single handed!&quot;, &quot;still just a first year!&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;In recognition of his outstanding services to Hogsnorts School I am pleased to award: one million points to Lionpaw House!&quot;</p>
<p>Deafening cheers come from the Lionpaw House students all around you.</p>
<p>&quot;Did you hear that?&quot; cries Aaron Bleezeley. &quot;A million points! Last year the Lionpaw house only got 600 points for the whole year! We'll win the House Cup for sure, well done Arthur!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What is more,&quot; continues Slumblebore, &quot;any unused Lionpaw House points will carry over from one year to the next. Which by my calculation means that Lionpaw House will win the House Cup for approximately the next... one hundred years.&quot; Slumblebore beams at you through his beard.</p>
<p>&quot;Lastly I hereby announce a new order of wizardry: the Order of the Arthropods. Arthur I grant you first class membership of the Order. Three cheers for Arthur Otley, hero of the school and founding member of the Order of the Arthropods!&quot;</p>
<p>The cheers ring out over and over again. The Lionpaw students raise you up on your shoulders and carry you round and round the school hall in triumph shouting &quot;Hooray for Arthur, hero of the school!&quot;</p>
<p>CONGRATULATIONS - YOU HAVE ACHIEVED THE HERO OF THE SCHOOL ENDING</p><p></p>

Woodlouse warfare</h2>
<p>"Somnolencia salchicha sabrosa," you cry, brandishing your wand fiercely.
</p><p>A surge of magical power flows through your body, down your arm and out through the wand. A shower of golden sparks races down the corridor raining down onto the three beetles.</p>
<p>Each beetle glows gold for an instant before slowly rolling onto their side and then their backs, six legs waggling gently in the air.</p>
<p>&quot;Did you kill them?&quot; asks Aaron.</p>
<p>&quot;No that was a sleeping spell. Look you can see their legs are still moving.&quot;</p>
<p>They must be dreaming some pleasant beetle dream, perhaps of cantering through a leafy carboniferous glade, as their legs make little wiggles in the air.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's get past them before they wake up.&quot;</p>
<p>You and Aaron carefully step over the sleeping beetles and onwards down the corridor.</p>
<p>You descend a spiral staircase now and the air is getting dank and stale. It can't be long before you arrive in the dungeon.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the staircase it is pitch black.</p>
<p>You raise your wand and the tip emits a faint golden light, just enough to see by.</p>
<p>You almost wish you hadn't.</p>
<p>Revealed by the dim light of your wand you can see the floor and the walls are completely covered in woodlice. Millions upon millions of them cling to the damp stone slabs that make up the corridor. Millions more cover the flagstones, waving their repulsive little antennae. Others have curled up into balls and are rolling around irresponsibly.</p>
<p>Do woodlice even have eyes? You don't know but when you turned on your light they all seemed to turn and look at you.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh my gosh Arthur, what are we going to do? There are too many of them to fight!&quot;</p>

The magical infinite</h2>
<p>Putting your hand into a stream of golden sparkles arcing by, you close your eyes and breathe slowly. 
</p><p>A sense of peace and serenity passes through you. You feel light, translucent: almost as if you have become one of the golden sparkles floating away.</p>
<p>Not floating <em>up</em> but somehow floating <em>through</em>, and you become aware of a subtle change in the air around you.</p>
<p>When you open your eyes you realise that you are now <em>outside</em> the infinite void that you had been floating in moments before.</p>
<p>In front of you is a large iridescent bubble, that has - impossibly but undeniably - wrapped up the infinite void that you were inside moments before. Peering closely through the bubble membrane, you can just make out the shimmering ribbons of golden magic arcing within it.</p>
<p>You realise that you have in some way gone <em>further up</em> and <em>further out</em>, onto another higher plane.</p>
<p>You notice other large iridescent bubbles floating around you.</p>
<p>One bubble in particular catches your eye.</p>
<p>In it you see another boy, about your age, with a mop of black hair, wizard robes and a peculiar scar on his forehead. Even though you have never met him before you feel you know who he is and a great feeling of warm friendliness comes over you.</p>
<p>Almost as if the boy in the bubble senses your thoughts he looks up and smiles.</p>
<p>You have a sudden insight that this place must be a place of almost infinite possibilities. Myriad bubbles fill the space around you - each bubble a different universe, each bubble a different possibility. You realise that together the bubbles must represent <em>every</em> possibility.</p>
<p>If you can imagine yourself in this place, you can be in any place.</p>
<p>You smile back at the boy with the funny scar on his forehead in the bubble next to you. Even though he can't see you, he must be able to sense you as you can sense him.</p>
<p>After contemplating the multiverse for a moment, or perhaps an eternity, you idly wonder whether you will head back to plane 42, or will you float out of and away from this story altogether?</p>
<p>CONGRATULATIONS YOU HAVE ACHIEVED THE INFINITE POSSIBILITIES ENDING. YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT! STOP HERE OR CONTINUE AND TURN TO ANY NUMBER...</p><p></p>

Defense against Dark Magic</h2>
<p>You decide to go to the Defense Against Dark Magic class next. With Slumblebore warning of danger lurking in the dungeon, you want to be prepared.
</p><p>Professor Madame Blavatsky's classroom is tucked away in an inconspicuous side passage and you almost miss it as you walk past. The inside is much more impressive though, with the floor and walls covered in inky black runes and pictograms, protecting the room against baleful influences.</p>
<p>The professor herself is sitting cross-legged on a little platform at the front of the classroom with her eyes closed while the children file in.</p>
<p>She is a short lady, wearing black robes and, because she is sitting with her legs crossed, looks a little like a large black frog. Her face is pale, almost white, and you can see networks of blue veins under the skin near her temples, like a river draining into a swamp.</p>
<p>As the last child sits down, she opens her eyes.</p>
<p>Her eyeballs gleam white, her irises a brilliant blue.</p>
<p>&quot;Welcome children, to Defence Against Dark Magic. The most important lesson you will learn today is...&quot; Blavatsky's melodious, soothing voice pauses for a moment.</p>
<p>&quot;...control over your own mind. Because it is only when you have full control over yourself that you can hope to resist the control that dark forces may wish to exercise upon you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And what is the path to self control?&quot;</p>
<p>There is silence in the room.</p>
<p>&quot;It is self awareness. It is only by knowing yourself that you can control yourself.&quot;</p>
<p>You look over at Kensley and frown. This seems a long way from good old practical down-to-earth magic learning.</p>
<p>&quot;But...&quot; continues Madame Blavatsky, &quot;I sense a doubter in the room. You!&quot; She turns her blue eyes on yours and fixes you in her gaze.</p>
<p>&quot;Have you already mastered yourself young man,&quot; she says to you. &quot;Do you really know who you are?&quot;</p>

<p>"Die beetles, die!" you cry, running towards the three giant bombardier beetles. 
</p><p>In your battle rage you forget all about magic and your wand, you just want to reach the beetles and grapple them with your bare hands, mano a beetlo.</p>
<p>&quot;Yaaaah!&quot; you cry, closing the distance fast...</p>
<p>...but not fast enough. The three beetles swiftly raise up their bottoms, and shoot out three streams of superheated acid, accompanied by three loud popping sounds.</p>
<p>One stream misses your head by inches, another strikes the wall beside you, the third the floor in front.</p>
<p>&quot;Hahahaha, you missed me, you little...&quot;</p>
<p>But you never get the chance to tell them exactly what type of little things they are because at that moment your foot slips on the pool of acid on the floor and slides out from underneath you. You fly through the air very briefly before slamming into the floor, bumping your head hard enough to knock you out cold.</p><p></p>

The final decision</h2>
<p>"What did you do that for?" you cry. "I thought he was your friend!"
</p><p>&quot;Eric Knid is... weak,&quot; replies Azog. &quot;His only purpose was to help me lure the chosen one - you - down here. Now that you have arrived, I no longer need him.&quot;</p>
<p>Azog stepped delicately over the snoring form of Professor Knid and advances towards you.</p>
<p>&quot;Just think Arthur. Together we could achieve so much. You, the chosen one with your one-of-a-kind wand and me with all the armies of the arthropods at my command! We could do anything. We could do everything!&quot;</p>
<p>While Azog is talking he is getting steadily closer and closer to you. You find yourself mesmerised by his eight tiny compound eyes. Daniel is also rooted to the spot.</p>
<p>Perhaps you <em>should</em> join with Azog and stand up for the down-trodden insect hordes - they have been most unfairly treated over the years. But on the other hand <em>stopping</em> Azog in his plan for school domination would go down well with the other students, and may give you the opportunity for dissecting a few of these fascinating little critters to learn about what makes them tick. And  didn't Slumblebore promise you a million points?</p>
<p>&quot;You must choose now Arthur,&quot; says Azog quietly. &quot;Are you with me? Or against me?&quot;</p><p></p>

The Hedgehog House Tower</h2>
<p>You queue up patiently with the other Hedgehog House students as you prepare to leave the dining room. Standing next to Kensley Potato you smile shyly at her - it is funny to think that you will be friends for the next 6 years, or maybe for life.
</p><p>&quot;Hoggers, follow me!&quot; calls out an older girl from the front of the line, and you all file after her obediently.</p>
<p>The girl leads you for what seems like ages, along long winding stone passageways that at times are so smooth that they must have been built by magic, at other times so rough and uneven that you keep tripping. They pass by soaring windows with beautiful stained glass scenes showing witches on broomsticks and unicorns jumping over rainbows. They run low underground in damp dark tunnels that are lit only by the occasional flickering torch.</p>
<p>At last just as your feet were starting to drag with tiredness, the girl leading the way stops abruptly.</p>
<p>&quot;Well done everyone,&quot; she says. &quot;We've arrived. Welcome to Hedgehog House tower.&quot;</p>
<p>You realise that you have stopped just before a stone archway painted in the Hedgehog House colours of brown. The stone arch itself is carved into the shape of a hedgehog stretched over the path.</p>
<p>&quot;Now Hoggers,&quot; continues the girl. &quot;Remember that it is only Hedgehog House students - Hoggers - who can enter this tower. So if you have friends in other houses...&quot; the children around you make tutting and pshaw sounds &quot;...you will have to meet them somewhere else!</p>
<p>&quot;First years we still have a bit more walking to do but you will be able to rest soon so keep going.&quot;</p>
<p>With that she turns and strides through the archway. You, Kensley, and all the other children follow her. Beyond the archway is a winding stone staircase that spirals slowly upwards. After 500 steps you lose count and you just plod on, eyes only on the step in front.</p>
<p>Just at the point when you were beginning to wonder if there is any more tower left to climb you bump into Kensley who has come to a sudden halt in front of you. The whole line of children has stopped and you can hear them whisper to each other: &quot;There's a door at the top, the girl is opening the door...&quot;.</p>
<p>You can't see the door yet because it is around another turn of the spiral staircase but you hear a creaking sound as it opens. Unexpectedly, a fresh earthy smell wafts down the staircase.</p>
<p>The children shuffle upwards.</p>
<p>When you reach the doorway you stop and stare. You can't believe what you are seeing. Rather than the top of a tower as you expected the stairs have led to a short tunnel that emerges from... the side of a hill. In the distance you can see - impossibly - Hogsnorts School. Somehow Hognsorts School is both just behind you in the passageway and at the same time it is far away across the broken countryside.</p>
<p>By some powerful magic the Hedgehog House staircase has taken you a mile <em>away</em> from the school and then deep underground.</p>
<p>You look around the grassy hillside that you have emerged onto and see a series of smooth stony paths branching out all over the hill. The paths lead past circular doors set into the hill. Over each circular door is a small sign.</p>
<p>You read the one closest to you: &quot;Brian Banana&quot; it says.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah there we go!&quot; You hear a voice behind you and someone shoulders past, walks to the door and goes inside.</p>
<p>&quot;See you later Brian!&quot; someone shouts out.</p>
<p>So that must be... Brian Banana, you think. And that door leads to his own little hole... and if <em>he</em> has a hole... everyone must have a hole, including me!</p>
<p>&quot;Kensley,&quot; you cry out, full of energy again. &quot;Let's find our holes!&quot;</p>
<p>You both run off huffing down the path and before long you see a round door, painted green, with your name written on a sign above it: &quot;Arthur Otley&quot;. Next to it is another door with &quot;Kensley Potato&quot; spelled out above.</p>
<p>You push on the shiny yellow brass knob in the centre of the green door and it swings open.</p>
<p>You are confronted by the most comfortable little living hole you could imagine: lined with wood, and carpeted, there are polished chairs and pegs for coats. The tunnel (because it was a tunnel really, not a hole as you had first thought) winds on into the side of the hill, with rooms leading off it left and right: bedrooms, bathrooms, cellars, pantries, wardrobes, all well stocked. In the rooms to the left of the tunnel deep-set round windows look out onto the hillside and meadows beyond, with Hogsnorts School far away.</p>
<p>After passing a dozen rooms, including one that seems dedicated to gaming with four different types of games console in it, plus a virtual reality headset, you arrive at your own bedroom, warm and comfortable. You lie down on the soft welcoming bed that occupies half the room. While you eat the mint chocolate that you found on the pillow, and cuddle the soft hedgehog toy, also left for you on the bed, you find yourself smiling.</p>
<p>In this little Hogger-hole safe underground you feel relaxed and secure. As your eyes close and you drift off to sleep your last thought is that, yes, I could be happy here.</p><p></p>

A speedy recovery</h2>
<p>With a groan you open your eyes.
</p><p>Looking around you you appear to be in the Hogsnorts School hospital. You see Daniel lying next to you on an identical bed, also groaning. Various medical instruments hang on the walls: stethoscopes, ear trumpets, bone-saws, syringes and thaumometers.</p>
<p>How did I get here? you wonder. Then it comes back to you and you shudder: the dungeon.</p>
<p>Something bad is definitely going on down there. Now even more than before you realise that you <em>have</em> to figure out what is going on and put a stop to it. It is up to you - and for next time you know at least one choice that you should not make again...</p>
<p>&quot;Hello Arther and Daniel. I see you have returned to the conscious realm.&quot; Madame Blavatsky, the Professor of Defence Against Dark Magic walks into the room.</p>
<p>&quot;Wssrrflbittit?&quot; you mumble.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes you had quite a shock back there I'm sure. When Slumblebore found you, you were both completely unconscious. But don't worry you will make a full recovery - the antiodarkotics I gave you will flush all the bad magic out shortly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you&quot; you manage to say.</p>
<p>&quot;But the most important thing is that you get some rest. I'm going to cast a sleeping spell on you now, timed so that you will wake up tomorrow morning at 7am. When you are sleeping soundly I will teleport you to your own bedrooms in your House Tower.&quot;</p>
<p>As she chants the magic words &quot;<em>somnolencia salchicha sabrosa</em>&quot; you try to speak but you can't stop yourself drifting away.</p>
<p>What is in the dungeon? you desperately want to ask. Your lips form the word &quot;Wha...?&quot;...</p><p></p>

<p>Before long you have found your way through the winding pathways and have gone <em>up</em> and <em>out</em> to the cool hillside where all the Hogger Holes are dug. You walk along the charming little path to your lovely green front door.</p>
<p>You feel your spirits lift: could anyone have a lovelier home to come back to than this?</p>

School hero</h2>
<p>It takes you just an instant to decide. 
</p><p>No way are you going to join forces with a bunch of insects and take over the school! The school is just fine the way it is. The only problem is... you are not sure how Azog is going to react when you tell him you are not joining his insect army.</p>
<p>You fiddle nervously with something in your pocket and realise it is the golden ring that dropped out of Kensley's pocket. Almost without you noticing it slips onto your finger.</p>
<p>Immediately there is uproar in the dungeon.</p>
<p>&quot;Where did he go!&quot; Azog is roaring out. &quot;Where is the chosen one!&quot;</p>
<p>Insects are scuttling to and fro, Azog is still shouting, but not one of them is looking at you.</p>
<p>Then it dawns on you: the ring must be have made you invisible! You remember that the writing on the ring said '<em>In ghostly darkness shroud you</em>' and now you are completely hidden by its powerful magic.</p>
<p>&quot;Never mind the boy!&quot; roars Azog. &quot;We rise without him - follow me!&quot;</p>
<p>From out of cracks in the walls, ceiling and floor crawl millions upon millions of arthropods: beetles, woodlice, ants, millipedes, earwigs, spiders in a great stream heading for the dungeon door and up into the school.</p>
<p>Back flat against the wall and hardly daring to breathe, you wait for them all to pass - a great river, a torrent of arthropods - and when the last millipede has marched out of the door, you wait another five minutes and then quietly tip toe after them.</p>
<p>Sometime later when you emerge out of the dungeon door into the school, the atmosphere is still, quiet, menacing. But there is a faint hum of noise - coming from the Great Hall.</p>
<p>You quietly slip into the Great Hall from a side door, and have to jam your fist into your mouth to stifle a shriek of horror.</p>
<p>The insects, led by Azog, have wasted no time in herding all the students and teachers out of their beds and into the hall. The students are sitting on their benches looking terrified, and at the front of the hall you see the teachers. They are wrapped up in an impossibly large spider web, stuck fast. Surrounding them all on the walls and the ceiling is the numberless insect army.</p>
<p>You look up and this time you can't prevent a little gasp. Slumblebore himself, the greatest wizard of the age, is spun up like a dead fly and is dangling upside from the ceiling, slowly spinning on an enormously thick silk thread fixed to his ankles.</p>
<p>On the stage Azog is haranguing the crowd with his harsh, strident voice.</p>
<p>&quot;...and no more will insects be trodden on, squashed and abused. The Order of the Arthropods has begun and you will all acknowledge me, me me...&quot; Azog's voice echoes strangely around the room.</p>
<p>Despite your crippling fear you know what you have to do.</p>
<p>Walking softly around the edge of the Hall, you creep on to the stage and behind Azog, the spider king.</p>
<p>Protected by the invisibility of your magic ring, no one notices you as you quietly, oh so quietly, step towards Azog, who continues to cajole and threaten the students.</p>
<p>You raise your foot and bring it down in one swift movement, right on top of Azog.</p>
<p>Squelch.</p><p></p>

Wesley the Weasel</h2>
<p>As you reach out a hand to pat the weasel on the head, he bares his sharp teeth at you and hisses menacingly. You stop and look up at Slumblebore with a frown.
</p><p>&quot;Ah, I'm afraid that Wesley has taken a dislike to you. He's normally a very friendly and affectionate weasel but he hates all Snakefang House students and he can sniff them out instantly.&quot;</p>
<p>Slumblebore speaks sharply to his pet: &quot;Wesley! Come here boy! Here!&quot;</p>
<p>The weasel cowers and scampers over to the big desk, where it hops up, squats in the plate of raisins and chatters to itself.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, my weasel here has a rather sad history. Wesley was once a real boy, a student just like you Arthur,&quot; Slumblebore explains, &quot;until another pupil from Snakefang House cast a spell on him in a dispute about who had the fastest broomstick. The spell transformed him permanently into the weasel you see now - and gave Wesley an enduring hatred of all Snakefang House students.</p>
<p>At the mention of Snakefang, Weasley narrows his eyes at you malevolently and brazenly defecates onto the plate of raisins.</p>
<p>&quot;Because he was an orphan I felt the kindest thing I could do was to adopt him as my pet. I had that fetching red waistcoat and matching hat that he wears specially made for him by my tailor in Hippotomews. That was when I named him Wesley. Wesley the Weasel has a rather good ring to it, don't you think? His original boy name was Barry. Or possibly Gary.</p>
<p>&quot;Why do I tell you all this Arthur? I want you to know that for all my students I will always be there for them. I will always be there for you, when you need help the most. Always, Arthur, always. Metaphorically. Just like I was for Gary. Or was it Larry.</p><p></p>

The first feast</h2>
<p>Everyone on Snakefang table cheers and greets you with the traditional 'welcome hiss' for new members.  
</p><p>&quot;Welcome to Snakefang House Arthur!&quot; says one girl who grins with pointed canines. &quot;Hogsnorts is the best school in the country and Snakefang is the best house in the school. That means you are now the best of the best!&quot;</p>
<p>She leaps to her feet suddenly and yells out &quot;Snake House rules!&quot;</p>
<p>The other children in Snakefang House stand up in a flash, answering her with their own shout of &quot;Snake House rules, yah, sssssssss&quot; sticking their tongues out and waggling them from side to side.</p>
<p>You grin broadly and let out a hiss of your own. This is the place for me alright, you think. Snakefang House: the best of the best. Oh yeah.</p>
<p>You are even happier when - the rest of the House Sorting complete - Slumblebore magically conjures up an incredible feast for dinner.</p>
<p>From out of thin air materializes platters of roast beef and boiled sprouts, Yorkshire pudding and mashed turnips, shepherds pie and boiled broccoli, toad in the hole and boiled potatoes, bubble and squeak and boiled carrots, apple crumble with strawberry ice cream, and spotted-dick drowning in custard.</p>
<p>&quot;Strawberry ice-cream, my favourite!&quot; Snako Malboy, who has also just been chosen for Snakefang House, licks his lips.</p>
<p>You and Snako get talking over dinner about your favourite flavours of ice-cream (his is strawberry, you like bubblegum flavour) and before long you are firm friends.</p>
<p>Halfway through the dinner, in a rite of initiation, all the first years crack open the eggs they received from Percy the Picking Pigeon. They pour the contents into a giant metal bowl on the Snakefang House table, and whisk them together. The older children heat the meal bowls with fiery jets from their magic wands and soon everyone in Snakefang House is sharing in a giant pigeon egg omelette.</p>
<p>As you chomp on your portion and feel the warm egg slide down your throat you feel your transformation into a Snakefanger is complete.</p>
<p>Then it's back to the regular food. You eat more than you have ever eaten before, enjoying yourself immensely. You wonder if Slumblebore is somehow making the food magically disappear after it enters your stomach, in a similar way to how he made the food appear on the table. But finally you realise you can't cram anything more into your belly, and let out a huge belch.</p>
<p>&quot;Children!&quot; Slumblebore stands, his beard streaked with mashed turnips and the odd boiled potato. He raises his hands for silence. &quot;Children! Now we have eaten our fill it is time for bed. Prefects lead the students to the House towers. And remember: the dungeons are off limits this term. We don't know what's down there, and neither do we want to.&quot;</p>
<p>The children rise to their feet, clutching their distended tummies, and prepare to leave the hall.</p>

The great Azog</h2>
<p>Perched on the shoulder of Professor Knid you and Daniel can just make out an averagely sized spider gazing at you thoughtfully through his compound eyes. 
</p><p>&quot;But, but... he's just a common spider... from the arachnid family paratropididae if I am not very much mistaken.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Have some respect!&quot; snaps the Prof. &quot;The Great Azog is of average size for a spider. And he is from an impeccable blue blooded family.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Size isn't everything, young Arthur,&quot; says King Azog the spider on the Prof's shoulder. &quot;As you yourself - a first year - well know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But Mr Azog,&quot; you ask &quot;What's so special about me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your wand shows that you are special Arthur. The core of your wand has a strand of silk from my bottom. Do you know how many other wands contain my silk? None whatsoever. Yours is the only one. You and the wand were made for each other.</p>
<p>&quot;You and your wand therefore have an unmatched power over all spiders in the world, as I do. But with your wand you are also bonded to me. Our fates are entwined, threaded together. Together we could achieve anything.</p>
<p>&quot;That's why I brought you here: to join me.</p>
<p>&quot;You didn't bring me here!&quot; you protest. &quot;I came here by myself, I <em>chose</em> to come here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You may think you did but every step of the way I was guiding your steps, bringing you closer.</p>
<p>&quot;Who guided you to the disabled toilet in Leeds Railway station, which led you to Hogsnorts? I was the spider that showed you the way.</p>
<p>&quot;Who gave you the courage to face Percy the Picking Pigeon by biting you on the bum?&quot; I was that spider.</p>
<p>&quot;Who showed you the way to the dungeon door? I was that spider too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But what do you want from him?&quot; interrupts Daniel suddenly. &quot;You want Arthur to join you but what are you asking him to do?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The time will soon come&quot; says the Great Azog &quot;For you to make your choice. This time one that really matters. But first <em>I</em> have a decision to make.&quot;</p>
<p>With that the Great Spider King of average size, who had been talking to you from the shoulder of Professor Knid all this time, takes a few quick steps sideways over to the Professor's neck and, without warning, bites down with his fangs.</p>
<p>Instantly Professor Knid collapses to a heap on the dungeon floor and starts snoring.</p><p></p>

<p>You swipe the nearest strand of spider silk. Despite it being as thick as a steel cable and twice as tough, the light sword slices through it with no effort at all and the spider web flops to the floor.</p>
<p>You steadily walk forwards, cutting through the spider web with your magical golden light sword, feeling the magic from the wand course through your body. The falling cobwebs settle into overlapping spiral patterns on the floor.</p>

Epilogue</h2>
<p>After taking over the school it was easy to recruit new students to your side. Attracted to your power the whole of Snakefang House joined you immediately. The Ravenclaws took a little bit longer to win over but after you had put a few of them in the dungeon for a while, most of them realised that you were serious and joined your force. The Hoggers of Hedgehog House joined you when the Ravenclaws gave in.
</p><p>It was only the Lionpaws who didn't join you but by then you already had enough students to put the second part of your plan into action.</p>
<p>You split the students into groups of four. Each quartet was assigned a small insect army to help them. Using teleportation magic each group went to a different country and sneaked into the president's house.</p>
<p>At exactly the same minute of the same hour of the same day your magical minions appeared before the presidents of every country in the world, whether they were in their office, asleep in the bedrooms or having a bath.</p>
<p>You personally assigned yourself the President of the United States, Snako at your side.</p>
<p>&quot;What the...? What's goin' on here? Who are you guys?&quot; floundered the president of the United States as you, Snako, two other wizards and a million termites materialise out of thin air into the Oval Office.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't bother to call your guards Mr President&quot; you say with a wolfish grin, &quot;They are fast asleep in the next room and they won't wake up until you tickle them under the armpits. I am here to inform you that a new world order has begun! The Order of the Arthropods! From now on you take orders only from me.&quot;</p>
<p>The President didn't like it - of course he didn't - but you menace him with the termites and he sees he has no choice.</p>
<p>Putting an enchanted earwig behind his ear, you explain to the president that whenever you have orders for him you will communicate through the earwig who will whisper into his ear hole.</p>
<p>&quot;You'd better do whatever he says Mr President&quot; adds Snako, &quot;Otherwise we'll set the termites on you.&quot;</p>
<p>And then you vanish, leaving behind a puff of smoke and a million twenties who crawl into cracks in the floor and walls, ready to spring out if called.</p>
<p>The next morning the world wakes up to some startling news. All the presidents of every country in the world have simultaneously announced three new laws for everyone:</p>
<ul>
<li>All the children of the world are allowed to play video games for as long as they like every day (even if it is bedtime).</li>
<li>Ice cream (at least three flavours) will be made available at every meal, as a starter.</li>
<li>Harming insects is a crime.</li>
</ul>
<p>You smile happily as you listen to the news on the television while licking your breakfast ice cream.</p>
<p>You wonder what your next instructions will be...</p>
<p>CONGRATULATIONS - YOU HAVE ACHIEVED THE WORLD DOMINATION ENDING!</p><p></p>

A fishy spell</h2>
<p>Surveying the hordes of woodlice in front of you, you raise your wand up high and cry out in a loud voice: 
</p><p>&quot;Amansa atún!&quot;</p>
<p>For a moment nothing happens.</p>
<p>Then three glimmering golden bubbles expand into the air in front of you, until they are the size of footballs. Inside each golden bubble is a large golden fish. The fish flap their fins and smile at you happily.</p>
<p>&quot;What's that spell?&quot; Aaron asks you.</p>
<p>&quot;Err I'm not sure, I was hoping it would be a whirlwind or lightning strike or something.&quot;</p>
<p>The golden bubbles pop and the three fish flop to the floor with a surprised look on their faces and then disappear with another pop.</p>
<p>The woodlice look on, unimpressed.</p><p></p>

The final decision</h2>
<p>"What did you do that for?" you cry. "I thought he was your friend!"
</p><p>&quot;Eric Knid is... weak,&quot; replies Azog. &quot;His only purpose was to help me lure the chosen one - you - down here. Now that you have arrived, I no longer need him.&quot;</p>
<p>Azog stepped delicately over the snoring form of Professor Knid and advances towards you.</p>
<p>&quot;Just think Arthur. Together we could achieve so much. You, the chosen one with your one-of-a-kind wand and me with all the armies of the arthropods at my command! We could do anything. We could do everything!&quot;</p>
<p>While Azog is talking he is getting steadily closer and closer to you. You find yourself mesmerised by his eight tiny compound eyes.</p>
<p>Perhaps you <em>should</em> take a stand, remake the world with Azog and the insect hordes, take over the school... on the other hand if you were to stop Azog now you would be a hero and would surely win the house cup for Snakefang - didn't Slumblebore promise you a million points?</p>
<p>&quot;You must choose now Arthur,&quot; says Azog quietly. &quot;Are you with me? Or against me?&quot;</p><p></p>

The great Azog</h2>
<p>Perched on the shoulder of Professor Knid you see an average sized spider gazing at you thoughtfully through his compound eyes. 
</p><p>&quot;But, but... he's just a little spider!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Have some respect!&quot; snaps the Prof. &quot;The Great Azog is of average size for a spider.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Size isn't everything, young Arthur,&quot; says King Azog the spider on the Prof's shoulder. &quot;As you yourself - a first year - well know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But King Azog,&quot; you ask &quot;What's so special about me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your wand shows that you are special Arthur. The core of your wand has a strand of silk from my bottom. Do you know how many other wands contain my silk? None whatsoever. Yours is the only one. You and the wand were made for each other.</p>
<p>&quot;You and your wand therefore have an unmatched power over all spiders in the world, as I do. But with your wand you are also bonded to me. Our fates are entwined, threaded together. Together we could achieve anything.</p>
<p>&quot;That's why I brought you here: to join me.</p>
<p>&quot;You didn't bring me here!&quot; you protest. &quot;I came here by myself, I <em>chose</em> to come here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You may think you did but every step of the way I was guiding your steps, bringing you closer.</p>
<p>&quot;Who guided you to the disabled toilet in Leeds Railway station, which led you to Hogsnorts? I was the spider that showed you the way.</p>
<p>&quot;Who gave you the courage to face Percy the Picking Pigeon by biting you on the bum?&quot; I was that spider.</p>
<p>&quot;Who showed you the way to the dungeon door? I was that spider too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But what do you want from me?&quot; you implore. &quot;You say I should join you but what are you asking me to do?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The time will soon come&quot; says the Great Azog &quot;For you to make your choice. This time one that really matters. But first <em>I</em> have a decision to make.&quot;</p>
<p>With that the Great Spider King of average size, who had been talking to you from the shoulder of Professor Knid all this time, takes a few quick steps sideways over to the Professor's neck and, without warning, bites down with his fangs.</p>
<p>Instantly Professor Knid collapses to a heap on the dungeon floor and starts snoring.</p><p></p>

What must I do?</h2>
<p>"I will do it, though I do not know how," you say. 
</p><p>&quot;My dear Arthur! Students really are amazing creatures. You can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a day and yet after a hundred years they can still surprise you.&quot; Slumblebore regards you with twinkling eyes and chuckles.</p>
<p>&quot;As to the how: first you must deactivate the locking spell on the dungeon door with the magic password: watermelon.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Watermelon?&quot; you repeat.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes: watermelon. I chose this password because it is my favourite fruit. Then you must descend the staircase that leads down into the very depths of the school. In the past students would be imprisoned in the dungeons for detention. Now they are mainly used to store broken chairs and Christmas decorations. But we go down there so infrequently there is no telling what evil is brewing in some dark corner.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I advise you to keep your wand at the ready and your wits sharp Arthur. And remember all the lessons the teachers have taught you. You will be put to the test and I do not know how it will turn out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sir,&quot; you ask. &quot;What do you <em>think</em> is down there?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Long have I studied this question, seeking knowledge in ancient scrolls and consulting with the wisest of the wise. Not a sausage. All I can say is that in the dead of night when I listen hard at the dungeon door I can sometimes hear a noise like the tramp of many thousands of feet. Faint but clear, almost as if those feet were... marching.&quot;</p><p></p>

Taking cover</h2>
<p>Dashing round the corner you raise your wand and yell "Paraguas pronto!"
</p><p>To your astonishment, from the end of your wand pops out a translucent sparkly golden umbrella.</p>
<p>In a flash it opens up - it is big enough to cover both you and Snako, which is just as well because in that same moment there is another popping sound and three more splotches of superheated acid from the beetles bottoms fly through the air towards you.</p>
<p>Splat splat splat!</p>
<p>The acid hits the magical golden umbrella, protecting you from harm.</p>
<p>But not the golden umbrella. In a few moments the acid has dissolved it to nothing, just a little bit of umbrella handle is left poking out of the end of your wand.</p>
<p>The three giant bombardier beetles raise their rear ends at you, and make menacing chittering noises.</p>
<p>&quot;Retreat!&quot; shouts Snako, &quot;We're sitting ducks!&quot;</p>
<p>You both turn back and flee, rounding the corner as more blobs of acid hit the wall behind you.</p>
<p>&quot;That wasn't exactly what I wanted the spell to do...&quot; you explain to Snako, embarrassed.</p><p></p>

Knid&#39;s insects</h2>
<p>You raise your hand and ask "Aren't snakes better than insects? They're bigger and cleverer for a start."
</p><p>&quot;Spoken like a true Snakefang student! Snakes! Pshaw. But Snakefangers are not known for their perspicacity, are they? No boy, snakes are <em>not</em> better than insects.</p>
<p>&quot;Firstly: snakes can't fly but insects can. Insects have been flying for over 350 million years! And to think we are always <em>so impressed</em> by the birds. Look at me, look at my feathers, I'm a bird! But insects have been flying for twice as long as birds - birds only evolved 150 million years ago. Pathetic.</p>
<p>&quot;Secondly: a snake's cleverness is nothing compared even to an ant, who - working together - can build homes hundreds of times taller than they are. Skyscrapers! With air-conditioning, nurseries, storage chambers. And what is a snake's home? Just a pile of old logs. Pathetic.</p>
<p>&quot;Thirdly: how many snakes are there in the world? Not many I can tell you. Or how many reptiles even? All the snakes, iguanas, and lizards put together?</p>
<p>Reptiles make up only 0.1% of all animal species.</p>
<p>Insects species make up 70% of all animal species, and if we include all arthropods that's over 80%. That means for every one reptile species (like a snake) there are <em>more than 600 insect species</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;No, it is clear to me, as it should now be clear to you, that snakes are pitiful, almost inconsequential creatures compared to insects and arthropods.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But sir,&quot; interrupts Snako, &quot;insects <em>are</em> disgusting...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh the cheek of it! Who is to say that you are not disgusting young man with your.... goggly eyes and snotty nose? There will come a day - and maybe sooner than you think - when everyone will appreciate the magnificence of an insect, when people don't shudder when I brush past them with my cloak. Yes you will appreciate those 'disgusting' insects soon enough my boy.&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Jape paused and pinched the bridge of his nose with two fingers. &quot;Class dismissed. Your homework is to write an essay with the title 'What I love most about insects and arthropods'. Two thousand words minimum.&quot;</p><p></p>

Dinner time</h2>
<p>Joining a gaggle of other Hogger students you head off on the long winding route back to the Hogsnorts Great Hall to get your dinner.
</p><p>You take a seat at the Hedgehog table and look around you, amazed.</p>
<p>Tonight Slumblebore has enchanted the walls and ceiling of the Great Hall to look like a lush and humid jungle. But the perspective of the students sitting in the hall is as if they are a tiny creature in the undergrowth - blades of grass tower above them, giant ants scurry past and occasionally birds that appear to be the size of aeroplanes swoop overhead.</p>
<p>You stare wide eyed as a stag beetle lumbers past you, each footstep making the ground vibrate. It is a fantastic, incredible scene, and a bit scary</p>
<p>&quot;Don't forget to eat Arthur!&quot; Kensley reminds you with a smile.</p>
<p>You look down to see yet another incredible feast.</p>
<p>In keeping with the enchanted hall, where the ceiling and walls show everything huge, normal food has been enchanted to an enormous size. Garden peas the size of tennis balls are piled on a plate. Sausages the size of small boats lie lengthways on the table swimming in gravy. Roast potatoes bigger than your head sit in a dish that would be considered big if it was a bathtub.</p>
<p>It is all so delicious you can't stop an involuntary dribble which you quickly wipe from your chin with the table cloth.</p>
<p>You cram food into your mouth and gulp it down.</p>
<p>In a bizarre magical twist, as soon as the food is in your tummy it returns to its normal size, so you have to eat vast quantities of the enchanted sausage and veg to fill yourself up. This suits you and Kensley just fine - eating is one of your favourite things!</p>
<p>When you are finally reaching the end of the meal the enchanted scene suddenly transforms into a terrific battle as a stream of army ants overruns the jungle undergrowth attacking everything in their path with their fearsome mandibles. The Great Hall appears to be <em>picked up</em> and <em>carried along</em> by these implacable insects, and enchanted chairs tilt crazily as you ride along on the back of the army ant horde.</p>
<p>It is looking grim for the students and several Hedgehog House students, including Kensley, vomit on the floor, overcome with fright and motion sickness.</p>
<p>But just at the point the ants are taking the Great Hall down into their underground lair, in this intricate magical simulation, a small herd of ant-eaters charge onto the scene. Their long flexible tongues lash out from side to side, slurping up ants by the thousand and soon the army ant horde is no more, leaving the Great Hall in peace once more on the forest floor.</p>
<p>&quot;Hooray for Hogsnorts, hooray for Slumblebore!&quot; you shout, delighted at the evening's entertainment, even if it was a bit scary. You lead the Hoggers in a chant of &quot;Hoggers up, Hoggers down, Hoggers hoggers stand your ground&quot; and everyone cheers in general merriment, ending the best dinner you have ever had.</p>

The dark web</h2>
<p>You and Kensley start pushing at the spider web with your hands.
</p><p>It is amazingly strong and also <em>sticky</em>. When you push a strand it becomes harder and harder to unstick your hands.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur&quot;, cries Kensley, &quot;Help me, I'm stuck!&quot;</p>
<p>You turn to the side and see that somehow Kensley has got herself totally tangled up in the web - she is hanging upside down with spider webs curled round her ankles and her hair brushing the floor.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh dear oh dear, I'm going to see if I can get through to help you Kensley&quot; you reply but as you try to move over towards her you feel thick ropes of spider web curl around your legs and lift you up into the air. In an instant you are as helpless as she is.</p>
<p>You feel your panic rising as you struggle. Who is going to help you now? No-one even knows that you are here except perhaps Slumblebore.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh no! Look Arthur - spiders! Millions of spiders!&quot;</p>
<p>Kensley is right. Crawling out of the cracks of the walls, floor and ceiling is a host of spiders. They scurry along the webs heading towards you. In a sudden insight you realise that these spiders have made the webs themselves, working as a one enormous team to add strand after strand of spider silk until they had created these rope-thick cobwebs. So many spiders working as one! What could they not achieve together?</p>
<p>Then all thoughts flee from your mind as the wave of spiders reach you. They stop inches away.</p>
<p>One lone spider - no bigger than the rest - scuttles out of the pack, delicately steps onto your robes then up to your neck. You see a flash of tiny fangs then you fade into unconsciousness.</p><p></p>

Mirror mirror on the walls</h2>
<p>You and Daniel decide to investigate the nearest stone staircase. From the bottom all you can see is that it winds up to some shadowy and little visited part of the school. 
</p><p>At the top of the stone stairs, you encounter a passageway lined with suits of armour. The empty helmets are turned in your direction and twist to follow you and Daniel as you walk past. You wonder what curious magical enchantment is making them move: the whole effect is rather clever.</p>
<p>At the end of the corridor there is a single door which swings open on silent hinges at your touch.</p>
<p>The room inside is small, dark and bare - but not quite empty.</p>
<p>Next to one wall there is a mirror, with the words above it 'Look at me if you dare, you will see your soul laid bare'.</p>
<p>Opposite, against another wall there's <em>another</em> mirror. Above this one it says 'Stare at me and you will see, what you want to come to be.'</p>
<p>Daniel relaxes. &quot;I know what these are! They're mirrors of desire. They show you what you most want in your whole life, maybe even something you didn't even realise. We've got one of those back home in the bathroom.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's remarkable!&quot; you breathe, and step up in front of one of the mirrors nervously.</p>
<p>You look at your reflection in the mirror and see...</p>
<p>...a taller, grown up version of yourself. You are wearing a flowing white gown, sun glasses and in your hand you are holding some papers. Squinting more closely you can just make out the title written in the papers: 'A synthesis of science and magic, how to join the two most powerful forces in the universe and create limitless, free electricity without any pollution'. Behind Arthur in the mirror you can make out a huge crowd of admirers.</p>
<p>&quot;Look at me in the mirror Daniel, I look like the cleverest man in the world!&quot;</p>
<p>Then you catch the reflection of the mirror behind you in the mirror in front of you - the reflection of the reflection.</p>
<p>In <em>that</em> reflection you are quietly reading a comic, sitting on a comfortable sofa, while drinking a steaming cup of hot chocolate.</p>
<p>&quot;That's funny,&quot; you say. &quot;The reflection of my reflection in the mirror behind me doesn't look quite as smart and cool at all...&quot;</p>
<p>Then it dawns on you.</p>
<p>That famous brain box version of yourself doesn't <em>want</em> all that fame and attention. It's all too much. It would be too much for me! What you are seeing is the famous boffin version of you's most earnest desire - which is for a quiet life, reading a Dogman comic.</p>
<p>You angle your head to catch more reflections of reflections and see the images of yourself curve away into infinity.</p>
<p>With each reflection's reflection the boffin version of yourself is just that little bit less boffinated and the quiet version of yourself becomes a little bit less quiet. Far into the depths of the mirrors you can just make out an Arthur just like yourself, waving back at you.</p>
<p>You shake your head, confused, and tell Daniel what you saw.</p>
<p>&quot;That's it!&quot; he says. &quot;Don't you see? The person you really want to be, when you get right down to it, is yourself.&quot;</p><p></p>

The heart of the dungeon</h2>
<p>You remember that woodlice are one of the few creatures that are completely immune to magic of any kind, and decide to cast a heat spell to clear a path indirectly. 
</p><p>You raise your wand. &quot;Fiel fresa fusila fuego!&quot;</p>
<p>A magical flame whooshes out of your wand, sending golden sparks shooting.</p>
<p>The flame doesn't harm the woodlice, but it heats the air, and dries it. The woodlice have no option but to retreat: without moisture they can't absorb oxygen, they would suffocate.</p>
<p>This leaves a path.</p>
<p>&quot;Wait!&quot; says Aaron. &quot;I... I can't go any further.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What's wrong?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's the woodlice. I have had a terrible fear of them ever since one rolled up my nose as a baby. I can't... I just can't go on.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Listen Aaron, it's ok. I'll keep going but you should turn back and tell Slumblebore what we have found down here: the spider webs, the beetles, the woodlice. He needs to know what's going on.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, yes... thank you Arthur. Slumblebore needs to know,&quot; says Aaron in relief. &quot;I'll go and get help.&quot;</p>
<p>Aaron turns and hot-foots it back the way you came.</p>
<p>As his hurried footsteps fade into the distant darkness, you breathe deeply and plunge forwards past the woodlouse army who are retreating to the still moist cracks in the stone.</p>
<p>After walking further down the dank, chilly passage you come to an iron bar door.</p>
<p>Just beyond you can hear a faint murmur of voices.</p>

</p><p>Aiming your wand at the beetles... nothing happens.</p>
<p>&quot;What are you trying to do?&quot; shouts Aaron.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know! I just thought that might work!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's not even magic that's just gibberish!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well I don't see you doing any better, why don't you try to...&quot;</p>
<p>But you never get the chance to tell Aaron what he should try to do. Three pops are followed by three blasts of superheated acid.</p>
<p>You try to duck out of the way but you are just a fraction too slow. One splurge of acid grazes your forehead and you fall to the ground, overcome.</p>
<p>Aaron hits the ground heavily beside you.</p>
<p>The last thing you see before you lose consciousness is the three giant bombardier beetles doing what appears to be a celebratory dance at the far end of the corridor.</p><p></p>

<p>You and Daniel head to the main hall where you had dinner on the first night. There on the wall are pinned the lesson timetables for the different year groups. Lots of children clamour round trying to see where to go next.

Knid&#39;s spell</h2>
<p>You sit still not wanting to encourage the professor, and none of the other students wants to disagree with him either. 
</p><p>&quot;Good. Good.&quot; says Professor Knid. &quot;Now we are all agreed, I can tell you that today we will be studying the marvellous woodlouse. Flies, deliver the woodlice!&quot;</p>
<p>At this command, a hundred or so flies detach themselves from Knid's cape, zoom over to a box on the professor's desk and pick up the woodlice, one between four flies. The flies then carry one woodlice to each student and drop it onto the desk in front of them. The flies buzz back to Professor Knid and reattach themselves to his cloak.</p>
<p>The little woodlouse on your desk appears disturbed at this unexpected flight. It takes one look at you then rolls up into a ball.</p>
<p>&quot;Now can anyone move their woodlouse using a magic spell?&quot; asks Knid. &quot;Try any magic spell that you know.&quot;</p>
<p>You raise your wand, point it at the woodlouse and mumble &quot;abracadabra&quot; rather hopefully.</p>
<p>You are delighted to see a little sparkle of gold stars shoot out of the end of your wand. The sparkles hit the woodlouse... and bounce right off! The woodlouse is unmoved.</p>
<p>Looking around the classroom you can see that the other children are having no more success than you did.</p>
<p>Aaron singed his own eyebrows when his lightning spell bounced off the woodlouse and hit him in the face. Kensley Potato's ice spell has frozen her desk into a solid block of ice but not touched the woodlouse. Brian Banana (another student from Hedgehog) has tried to make his woodlouse disappear but accidentally lost his wand in the process.</p>
<p>&quot;The woodlouse, children, as you are discovering, is completely impervious to magic. So if you want to move the woodlouse you must first <em>understand</em> the woodlouse. And the one thing that scares the woodlouse more than anything else is drying out. As soon as they lose their moisture they die. Now - look at this.&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Knid raises his wand in an impressively expansive gesture and recites: &quot;Fiel fresa fusila fuego!&quot;</p>
<p>A large flame whooshes out of the end of his wand and starts to bake the air around the woodlouse on his desk. Terrified of being dried out, the woodlouse unrolls and scuttles away as fast as he can.</p>
<p>&quot;So we can see that <em>indirect</em> magic can be powerful against even magic resistant creatures. And we didn't have to harm any arthropods in the process. Now children it's your turn. Wands at the ready!&quot;</p>
<p>You look down at your cowering woodlouse and, aiming with your wand, recite the words of the spell:</p>
<p>&quot;Fiel fresa fusila fuego!&quot;</p>
<p>From the tips of your fingers to the ends of your toes you can feel a powerful magic charge building in your body. It concentrates in your chest and then zooms along your arm and out of your wand in a very impressive jet of flame.</p>
<p>You are overjoyed at the result, the first time you have cast such a powerful spell. Just think what you could do with such magic!</p>
<p>The woodlouse feels the magical flames heat the air and desk around him, and scarpers.</p>
<p>&quot;I did it!&quot; you cry, and commit the words of the spell to your memory: fiel fresa fusila fuego.</p><p></p>

Bunking off</h2>
<p>"Let's take a look around, lessons can wait!" you say to Daniel and the two of you walk down the wooden corridor (which is actually the hollow inside of just one great branch of this mighty tree) towards the trunk.
</p><p>You enter the tree trunk about three stories up, and you can see Ravenwing students darting to and fro across the floor, heading off to their lessons. Some of them are whistling for parrots who fly off into the depths and retrieve arcane books, scrolls of ancient wisdom, and the occasional comic.</p>
<p>Soon they have all gone allowing you and Daniel the chance to explore uninterrupted.</p>
<p>The first place you go to is a room labelled 'FRUIT CORNER&quot;, just across the trunk from you. Fruit Corner turns out to be a large spherical room, with woody growths emerging from the walls and ceiling. At the end of each growth hangs a fruit that looks a bit like a giant strawberry and glows with a faint golden light.</p>
<p>You pick one from a branch and nibble the end tentatively. Immediately your eyes light up and you cram more into your mouth.</p>
<p>&quot;It's...&quot; scrunch &quot;the best thing...&quot; scrunch &quot;I have ever tasted...&quot; scrunch &quot;in my whole life!&quot;</p>
<p>It's like eating the best fruit salad you can imagine but also as if a luscious cream has been mixed in plus dollops of honey. After eating just one of these magical fruits you find you are completely full - and not in a feeling-sick-sort-of-way but in a totally-satisfied-and-not-at-all-feeling-sick kind of way.</p>
<p>The rest of the day is spent climbing up the inside of the tree trunk and sliding at tremendous speeds down the spiral wooden slides that are naturally polished with amber.</p>
<p>You also find a door in the tree to go outside and clamber around the branches for a while. You encounter the magical giant squirrels that live in the canopy - once normal red squirrels, eating the nuts of the tree has given them the power of speech as well as growing them to the size of kangaroos.</p>
<p>They invite you to climb on their backs, and they race to the top of the tree with you and Daniel clinging onto their fur and shouting with delight.</p>
<p>You swim in the pools of streaming water far out in the branches, captured in natural dips of the wood, and heated by some magic of the tree itself.</p>
<p>You meet the ancient raven with only one eye who lives at the very top of the tree, the raven that was befriended by the founder of Ravenwing House, Rebecca Ravenwing, all those centuries ago.</p>
<p>Finally you go back to the library inside the trunk of the tree and whistle for all the books you can think of.</p>
<p>Daniel reads 'Travels through the multiverse' by Daniel Colliers-Wood, a mind-blowing book which he will write in 25 years time. Also 'The Crying Potato' by his brother Robin Colliers-Wood, due to be published in only five years.</p>
<p>You enjoy 'Adventures with Dragons' by Arthur Otley and also 'Mr Poopy Head' by your brother Evan Otley, which he will write when he is only seven.</p>
<p>As you eat just one more delicious fruit-salad-fruit from the fruit corner room, the other Ravewing students traipse back into the massive trunk.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur, Daniel,&quot; shouts one anonymous bit-part student. &quot;it's dinner time!&quot;</p><p></p>

Back to the Tower</h2>
<p>"Let's go back to the House Tower," you say to Aaron. "I'm tired out, it must be really late now."
</p><p>The two of you trudge wearily back to the Lionpaw House Tower. It is a long way but somehow you remember the path perfectly - perhaps due to some 'homing' magic that all Lionpaw's absorb when they first go to the Tower.</p>
<p>Before long you have climbed the stone staircase and are in the Grand Lionpaw House Vestibule - the huge open space at the base of the tower, lit up with beautiful magical light-globes, and marble floor polished to a sheen by giant enchanted snails, and a faint smell of chlorine from the water park. You feel your spirits lift: could anyone have a better home to come back to than this?</p>
<p>&quot;Night night Arthur,&quot; says Aaron with a yawn. &quot;See you in the morning.&quot;</p>
<p>You both wearily climb the final stone staircase to your sleeping apartments, and enter.</p>
<p>Throwing your robes over the sofa, you have a quick refreshing shower in the ensuite bathroom, dry yourself with an enormous fluffy white towel, tuck yourself up into your luxurious four-poster bed and drift off to sleep.</p><p></p>

Slumblebore&#39;s office</h2>
<p>Slumblebore's office is easy to find, you just follow the signs pointing the way. When you reach it you see that the door is slightly ajar - and there is a light still on inside. Perhaps Slumblebore has gone to bed and forgotten to turn the light out.
</p><p>You motion Snako to wait outside and he nods vigorously. &quot;Don't get caught!&quot; he whispers.</p>
<p>You push on the half open door and immediately hear a voice:</p>
<p>&quot;Come in Arthur.&quot; It's Slumblebore - you've been rumbled!</p>
<p>&quot;Don't worry,&quot; Slumblebore says as if reading your thoughts. &quot;I have been waiting for you to come. I wanted to talk with you.&quot;</p>
<p>You walk into Slumblebore's office and look around you. Every inch of space has been used. Leather bound books on bookshelves line the walls. Paintings with ornate golden frames are hung all around, and ancient Hogsnorts headteachers stare down at you, blinking and sniffing. From the ceiling hang silver cages containing magical golden birds, tiny jewelled monkeys no bigger than your thumb and baby dragons curled up and sleeping. On the floor pentagrams have been marked out in yellow chalk and you almost trip over a live weasel dressed in a little red waistcoat that must be a weird pet. You resist the urge to give it a kick.</p>
<p>Slumblebore himself is sitting behind a massive wooden desk, piled high with manuscripts, scrolls, steaming goblets, plates of watermelon, little bowls of nuts and weasel droppings.</p>
<p>&quot;Care for a raisin?&quot; Slumblebore offers, brushing some weasel droppings onto the floor and proffering you a bowl.</p>
<p>&quot;Err no, thank you,&quot; you reply, not entirely convinced that the bowl is 100% raisins.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur, I'm glad you have come. There is something very serious for us to discuss, which concerns the safety of the entire school. I need your help. But first tell me, how are you settling into the school? Do you feel happy in your new house?&quot;</p><p></p>

School hero</h2>
<p>It takes you just an instant to decide. 
</p><p>Whipping out your wand you cry &quot;Fiel fresa fusila fuego!&quot; and flames shoot out, bathing the dungeon in flickering light. No way are you going to let Slumblebore down and the insects take over - you are going to save the school!</p>
<p>You were aiming your magical fire at Azog but he is too nimble and leaps out of the way.</p>
<p>&quot;You will regret your choice Arthur,&quot; screams the spider king in outrage. &quot;Insects, attack!&quot;</p>
<p>From out of cracks in the walls, ceiling and floor crawl millions upon millions of arthropods: beetles, woodlice, ants, millipedes, earwigs, spiders in a great stream heading straight for you.</p>
<p>This time you don't hesitate. You turn and flee.</p>
<p>Your heart pounding, you run back out of the dungeon up towards the school. But you are not running out of cowardice. You have a plan.</p>
<p>When you reach the enchanted door that leads down into the dungeon you dash through and slam it shut. You can hear the enchanted locking mechanism clicking shut.</p>
<p>There's only one way for the insects to get past the door now - through the keyhole. You turn and wait, your wand at the ready.</p>
<p>As soon as you see the first hairy little leg poking out of the keyhole you use your wand as a flamethrower shouting &quot;fiel fresa fusila fuego&quot; again and again until your voice is hoarse.</p>
<p>The air is full of the harsh high pitched cries of dying arthropods and the sizzle of roasting chitin. But still the insects come, propelled onwards by the Great Azog's iron will.</p>
<p>You are getting tired now, your arm is sore from being held up so long and you can feel your reserves of magical energy running out. You cannot hold out much longer.</p>
<p>For a moment the magical fire from your wand flickers and dies.</p>
<p>Then three things happen simultaneously:</p>
<p>One: Azog, sensing his chance, launches himself through the keyhole aiming straight for your face.</p>
<p>Two: Aaron and Slumblebore run round the corner to see you standing alone against the numberless insect foe.</p>
<p>Three: You draw your compass from your pocket, thinking that even as your magic fails you will be able to stab a few more of the blighters with the pointy end before you are overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Then...</p>
<p>Azog flies through the air, fangs at the ready, just as your arm holding the compass comes <em>up</em>. He impales himself on the point of the compass, which buries itself deep in the spider king's abdomen.</p>
<p>The last words of Azog the Great are &quot;Arthur... you have broken my heart...&quot;. Then a trickle of blue blood seeps out of the wound and Azog is no more.</p>
<p>With Azog a gonner the rest of the arthropod hordes lose all cohesion. When Slumblebore cautiously opens the door to the dungeon they are fleeing in all directions, and will trouble the school no more. Slumblebore lets off a few more blasts of fire to encourage them on their way.</p>
<p>&quot;You did it Arthur!&quot; cries Aaron. &quot;You saved the school - the evil has gone!&quot;</p>
<p>You stand still and listen carefully. Aaron is right. You cannot sense evilness any longer. The dungeons have been cleansed.</p>
<p>&quot;Well done indeed Arthur,&quot; and Slumblebore, turning back to you. &quot;I had a feeling that you were the special one. Without you I fear we would have been overrun by insects by now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was Eric Knid,&quot; you say to Slumblebore. &quot;It was Professor Knid who summoned the insect army, with Azog the spider king. He is down in the dungeon now unconscious. Azog bit him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Eric did you say? Well I'm not surprised. He always struck me as a bit of an odd fish. Nevermind we will pick him up in the morning and I shall give him an official reprimand. And if he does it again I will have no choice but to put him on a performance improvement plan.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But you Arthur, what else can I give <em>you</em> but my most heartfelt thanks.&quot; You can't suppress a broad grin and feel a warm glow in your heart at Slumblebore's praise. &quot;You truly are a hero, a hero of Hogsnorts School.&quot;</p><p></p>

The Order of the Athropods</h2>
<p>You hold out your hand to Azog and he puts his tiny spider legs on the tip of your finger. Looking into your eyes, he nods his head and climbs up onto your hand then up your arm and onto your shoulder.
</p><p>&quot;Athropods, prepare yourselves!&quot; shouts out Azog and out of the walls and ceiling untold millions of insects emerge, each one pitifully small but together forming a huge unstoppable army.</p>
<p>&quot;Today we have a new leader! He is the chosen one whose coming to the dungeon was foretold. He stands here before you: Arthur Otley!&quot;</p>
<p>Marvelling at the hordes of insects at your command you feel dizzy and excited. You realise that the insects of the world  <em>have</em> been overlooked and deserve justice - with you in charge. You raise your arm and clench your fist.</p>
<p>&quot;For too long has the insect world been downtrodden - literally - in this school,&quot; you say. &quot;From now on there will be a new house, above the four houses of Lionpaw, Ravenwing, Snakefang and Hedgehog. It will be a new Order to rule them! The Order of the Arthropods!&quot;</p>
<p>At the head of the insect army you and Azog pour out of the dungeon and into the school.</p>
<p>You stride into Slumblebore's office with Azog on your shoulder and millions of insects crawling on the floor, walls and ceiling just behind you.</p>
<p>Slumblebore is inside talking agitatedly to Aaron. You quickly appraise them of their situation: you have a vast insect army, they don't.</p>
<p>Offering Aaron a position as second in command of the Order of the Arthropods, you are delighted when he agrees to join your side.</p>
<p>You offer Slumblebore to continue in his role as headmaster, but only if he acknowledges you as Supreme Governor, and accepts that the Order of the Arthropods will from now on win the House Cup every year forever. Otherwise you will instruct your insect hordes to take over by force.</p>
<p>Slumblebore is reluctant, but he has no other option. If insects are seen running amok in the school it will be terrible publicity and the parents will withhold their school fees.</p>
<p>The next morning Slumblebore calls a general assembly of the school and announces the new order. The insect's army is hidden in cracks in the walls but ready to leap out if necessary.</p>
<p>&quot;And so,&quot; Slumblebore concludes,&quot;Arthur Otley must now be obeyed by everyone. Furthermore, there is a new school rule: anyone caught stepping on a spider or squashing an ant will be imprisoned within the dungeon - for life.&quot;</p>
<p>There are shocked gasps around the room. Only now do they truly realise the new reality - the Order of the Arthropods has begun!</p><p></p>

<p>Professor Jape is wearing a black cape with a red velvet lining and has a very pale almost white face. He smiles at the class warmly and gives a little wink.</p>
<p>&quot;Today we are going to learn some offensive magic. Now as you probably know offensive magic can be extremely dangerous. But that's not to say we can't have a bit of a laugh and a giggle as we go along eh? Eh children? Eh?&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Jape makes a loud high pitched giggling noise. Some of the other children laugh back nervously.</p>

</p><p>A flickering golden light slowly extends from the top of your wand until it is about a metre long. You swing the &quot;light sword&quot; around and it makes a satisfying swishing zooming sound. This should do the trick.</p>
<p>You swipe the nearest strand of spider silk and despite it being as thick as a steel cable and twice as tough, the light sword slices through it with no effort at all and the spider web flops to the floor.</p>
<p>You steadily walk forwards, cutting through the spider web with your magical golden light sword, feeling the magic from the wand course through your body.</p>
<p>Soon the spider web has gone. You and Aaron race down the passageway and skid around a corner...</p><p></p>

Inner peace</h2>
<p>"I'm Arthur Otley and I want to learn some spells" you say to Professor Blavatsky.
</p><p>&quot;Ah so impatient. And yet this impatience stops you learning about yourself. I can see that you are very far from self control as yet.&quot;</p>
<p>The teacher stands up and raises one hand.</p>
<p>&quot;But do not worry, any of you. Because we will start with a simple meditation session to help you gain control.&quot;</p>
<p>You groan inwardly. This sounds boring.</p>
<p>&quot;Close your eyes everyone,&quot; begins Professor Blavatsky. &quot;Make sure you are comfortable in your seats. Now I want you to focus on your breathing. Breathe in. Breathe out. Breathe in... and breathe out.</p>
<p>&quot;Feel the breath flowing into your nostrils. Concentrate on the sensation. Do you feel your nose hairs tickling? Perhaps a small bogey flapping around in your nasal passage? Just think about the breath, how it feels.&quot;</p>
<p>Despite yourself you feel your awareness sharpening, and you do indeed feel a small bogey in your nostril wobbling around as you breathe in and out.</p>
<p>&quot;Now I want you to think about a special number. The special number is 42. A four and then a two. Forty two. This number is not just a number it is also a place. A location. A place of calm that you can always turn to in moments of difficulty or stress.</p>
<p>&quot;This number 42 is a place within yourself, but it is a real place too that anyone can reach, if they just turn to that number... the number 42. As you turn to 42, just keep your thumb here so you know where to come back to.&quot;</p>
<p>Amazingly you feel a sensation as if you are floating somehow, except with your thumb stuck down in front of you. Concentrating fiercely you try with all your might to turn to 42. You float away...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&quot;Did anyone manage to meditate and reach 42?&quot; asks Madam Blavatsky.</p>
<p>You definitely feel you went... somewhere. You <em>think</em> this is what Professor Blavatsky meant.</p>
<p>&quot;Any time you find yourself in need of quiet and peace, just repeat this meditation exercise and think of the number 42 and you will find a place of calm and relaxation - but keep your thumb right where you are and you will be able to turn back whenever you want.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Class dismissed! We will meet again.&quot;</p><p></p>

Jape&#39;s spell</h2>
<p>Along with most of the other children you keep your hands down.
</p><p>&quot;You don't want to hear my jokes? Well I never!&quot; Professor Jape looks genuinely hurt for a moment, but quickly recovers his composure.</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps you will be laughing on the other side of your face by the end of this lesson.&quot; Jape gives another high pitched giggle and you all shift on your seats uneasily.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe,&quot; he continues, &quot;you will enjoy this one. I need a volunteer!&quot;</p>
<p>No one volunteers so Jape scans the classroom. He points at Kensley.</p>
<p>&quot;You! Come forward.&quot;</p>
<p>Kensley shuffles forward to the front of the class.</p>
<p>Without any warning Professor Jape whips out his wand, points it at Kensley and yells: &quot;<em>Vamos varita vencer vistosamente!</em>&quot;</p>
<p>A golden light extrudes from the tip of Jape's wand. The light looks like a solid sparkly golden beam and extends for one metre then stops emerging. Jape swings his wand around and you realise that he has created a magical golden light sword! As the golden beam swipes through the air it makes alarming swishing zoom noises.</p>
<p>&quot;En guard!&quot; snaps Jape to Kensley with a gleam in his eye before suddenly launching into a frenzied attack, swiping left and right with his light sword. In a flash he has covered the 5 metres to Kensley and he holds the light sword directly at Kensley's throat.</p>
<p>&quot;If you don't laugh at my jokes I will kill you.&quot; Jape says simply.</p>
<p>There is dead silence in the class. Everyone is holding their breath.</p>
<p>Then, almost in exact unison, everyone screams and runs out of the door, except Kensley who is rooted to the spot in fear, and you partly because you don't want to abandon your friend, and partly because you are too afraid to move.</p>
<p>Professor Jape lowers the light sword and gives a high pitched giggle.</p>
<p>&quot;I were just joking, didn't you know that?&quot; he said to the fleeing children. &quot;It were just a joke!&quot; he shouted louder at their fleeing backs.</p>
<p>Professor Jape sighs and says to you and Kensley: &quot;They can't take a joke, can they? Well lessons over now I suppose. But remember: <em>Vamos varita vencer vistosamente</em> that's a good one that is!&quot;</p>
<p>You and Kensley nod and swallow, and without saying another word, flee out of the classroom.</p><p></p>

Spelling trouble</h2>
<p>"I know I am called Arthur Otley," you say. "But is my name who I really am?"
</p><p>&quot;Excellent point Arthur! I can see by your question that you are already on the path to enlightenment. Because it is only when we realise that we <em>don't</em> know everything that we can learn.&quot;</p>
<p>Madame Blavatsky smiles at you. &quot;And because you are ready to learn I will now teach you your first spell.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But first can anyone tell me,&quot; she says addressing the whole class now, &quot;what is the most common cause of death for wizards and witches? Anyone?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Fighting trolls?&quot; suggests Aaron.</p>
<p>&quot;Soul suckers?&quot; proposes another child.</p>
<p>&quot;Dragon fire? Werewolves? Vampires?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, no and no again.&quot; replies Professor Blavatsky. &quot;The one thing that is most likely to kill you more than anything else is: each other.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Let me explain. Imagine it is night time, 3am in the morning. You hear a noise downstairs. Immediately you are on the alert. It could be burglars. Or more likely dark wizards on the attack. You creep downstairs, wand at the ready. You can hear them rummaging around in the kitchen. You leap out shouting the most deadly spells you can think of. Only to discover... it is your Uncle Brian who is visiting for the weekend and has come down in the night to help himself to a biscuit. Now he is paralysed on the kitchen floor, a look of horror on his face and the packet of biscuits grasped so tightly in his hand that no-one else will be eating them ever again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes I'm afraid to say that the most common cause of death is 'friendly fire', or over-reacting to an imagined threat. The sad fact is that you are all in far more danger from each other than from any evil sorcerer. Which is why the spell I am going to teach you to protect against dark magic is a sleeping spell. It is one I designed myself. To wake someone up from this spell you just need to tickle them under their armpits.&quot;</p>
<p>Blavatsky then whips out her wand and points it at Aaron.</p>
<p>&quot;Somnolencia salchicha sabrosa!&quot; she yells out.</p>
<p>A dart of pure golden light shoots out of the end of her wand and hits Aaron right in the middle of his forehead. In less than a half a second his head has sunk down to his arms on his desk and he is snoring like a sailor.</p>
<p>The class breaks out into a round of applause.</p>
<p>&quot;Make sure you get the pronunciation just right when you cast the spell&quot; Blavatksy advises as she walks over to Aaron and tickles him under the armpits.</p>
<p>&quot;He he he! What happened?&quot; says Aaron, confused.</p>
<p>The class splits into pairs and you practice sending each other to sleep. Because Aaron is still a bit drowsy you go first, pointing your wand at his forehead just as the teacher did:</p>
<p>&quot;Somnolencia salchicha sabrosa...&quot; you repeat carefully.</p>
<p>You feel a wonderful feeling of magical power gathering in your tummy. In an instant it has whooshed up out of your arm, channelled by the wand into a golden dart that zaps Aaron on the head, for the second time in as many minutes.</p>
<p>In no time at all he is asleep and snoring again.</p>
<p>&quot;I did it!&quot; you shout. &quot;The magic spell worked!&quot;</p>
<p>Delighted with your success you tickle Aaron under the armpits. As he wakes up giggling you try hard to memorise the spell 'Somnolencia salchicha sabrosa' - you never know when it may come in handy.</p><p></p>

<p>"It's working!" Kensley cries out. 
</p><p>But she has spoken too soon. The magic you have activated doesn't open the door instead it sets off a piercing alarm! An enchanted recording of Slumblebore's voice shouts out:</p>
<p>&quot;Intruders! Intruders! Beware, intruders are trying to get into the dungeon! Stop them! Intruders! Intruders!&quot;</p>
<p>Over and over again, the voice of Slumblebore cries out.</p>
<p>&quot;It didn't work! Oh no, oh no we are going to be in so much trouble! Run to the tower!&quot;</p>
<p>You and Kensley dash madly back to the Snakefang House tower, skidding round corners and leaping up stairs three at a time, the magical voice shouting out behind you.</p>
<p>At last, covered in sweat, you make it back undetected. You both run up into the Hedgehog Tower, out though the hillside and don't stop until you are safely inside your Hogger Holes, the door slammed shut behind you.</p><p></p>

The Order of the Athropods</h2>
<p>You hold out your hand to Azog and he puts his tiny spider legs on the tip of your finger. Looking into your eyes, he nods his head and climbs up onto your hand then up your arm and onto your shoulder.
</p><p>&quot;Athropods, prepare yourselves!&quot; shouts out Azog and out of the walls and ceiling untold millions of insects emerge, each one pitifully small but together forming a huge unstoppable army.</p>
<p>&quot;Today we have a new leader! He is the chosen one whose coming to the dungeon was foretold. He stands here before you: Arthur Otley!&quot;</p>
<p>Marvelling at the hordes of insects at your command you feel dizzy and excited. You realise that the insects of the world  <em>have</em> been overlooked and deserve justice - with you in charge. You raise your arm and clench your fist.</p>
<p>&quot;For too long has the insect world been downtrodden - literally - in this school,&quot; you say. &quot;From now on there will be a new house, above the four houses of Lionpaw, Ravenwing, Snakefang and Hedgehog. It will be a new Order to rule them! The Order of the Arthropods! First we will take over the school and then we will take over the world!&quot;</p>
<p>At the head of the insect army you and Azog pour out of the dungeon and into the school.</p>
<p>You stride into Slumblebore's office with Azog on your shoulder and millions of insects crawling on the floor, walls and ceiling just behind you.</p>
<p>Slumblebore is inside talking agitatedly to Snako. You quickly appraise them of their situation: you have a vast insect army, they don't.</p>
<p>Offering Snako a position as second in command of the Order of the Arthropods, he joins your side without a second's hesitation.</p>
<p>You offer Slumblebore to continue living at the school, but only if he resigns as headmaster and takes on a new role as janitor and personally cleans your house tower (without using magic) at least once a day. Otherwise he will be banished forever.</p>
<p>You also explain that there is a new fifth house now, the Order of the Arthropods, and from now on this house will win the house cup every year automatically - forever.</p>
<p>Slumblebore is reluctant, but he has no other option.</p>
<p>The next morning Slumblebore calls a general assembly of the school and announces the new order. The insect army is hidden in cracks in the walls but ready to leap out if necessary.</p>
<p>&quot;And so,&quot; Slumblebore concludes, &quot;Arthur Otley must now be obeyed by everyone. Furthermore, there is a new school rule: anyone caught stepping on a spider or squashing an ant will be imprisoned within the dungeon - for life.&quot;</p>
<p>There are shocked gasps around the room. Only now do they truly realise the new reality - the Order of the Arthropods has begun!</p><p></p>

<p>For a moment nothing happens.</p>
<p>Then three glimmering golden bubbles expand into the air in front of you, until they are the size of footballs. Inside each golden bubble is a large golden fish. The fish flap their fins and smile at you happily.</p>
<p>&quot;What's that spell?&quot; Snako asks you.</p>
<p>&quot;Err I'm not sure, I was hoping it would be a whirlwind or lightning strike or something.&quot;</p>
<p>The golden bubbles pop and the three fish flop to the floor with a surprised look on their faces and then disappear with another pop.</p>

Epilogue</h2>
<p>The next day all the children are called to the school hall for a special announcement.
</p><p>As you take your seats at the house tables you notice that the ceiling has been enchanted to a beautiful sky blue with fluffy clouds scudding past on one side and a huge flock of Monarch butterflies on the other.</p>
<p>&quot;Students,&quot; announces Slumblebore from the front of the hall. &quot;I have a very special announcement. Yesterday, unbeknownst to us, we were threatened by a vast and evil insect horde gathering in the school dungeon.&quot;</p>
<p>Slumblebore casts a severe glance at professor Knid, who looks down sheepishly at the table.</p>
<p>&quot;We were saved thanks to the bravery, resourcefulness and cleverness of one boy.</p>
<p>&quot;That boy is Arthur Otley.&quot;</p>
<p>You feel your cheeks go red as all the students in the school turn round to get a look at you and you hear whispers of &quot;yes that's him&quot;, &quot;defeated the insects single handed, with his friend Daniel!&quot;, &quot;still just a first year!&quot;, and &quot;wouldn't mess with that fella!&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;In recognition of his outstanding services to Hogsnorts School I am pleased to award: one million points to Ravenwing House!&quot;</p>
<p>Deafening cheers come from the Ravenwings House students all around you.</p>
<p>&quot;Did you hear that?&quot; cries Daniel Colliers-Wood. &quot;A million points! Last year Ravenwing house only got 600 points for the whole year! Now no-one will be able to beat us to the House Cup!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Lastly I hereby announce a new order of wizardry: the Order of the Arthropods. The purpose of this order is to further the study of insects under magical enchantment. And we will start with the source of all the trouble: the spider king Azog himself!&quot;</p>
<p>The students cheer again as Slumblebore hands you a beautiful golden cage, with a still groggy Azog held prisoner within.</p>
<p>&quot;Three cheers for Arthur Otley, hero of the school and founding genius of the Order of the Arthropods!&quot;</p>
<p>With the cheers ringing in your ears you head straight for the magical laboratory with Daniel at your side, and Azog in his cage under your arm. Your head is full of all the insect related magical inventions you might create: enchanted chitin armour, spider silk swingers, acid blasters, who knows what else? With Azog to probe, you will be literally at the cutting edge of magical science and can't wait to see what you will learn!</p>
<p>CONGRATULATIONS - YOU HAVE ACHIEVED THE GENIUS OF THE SCHOOL ENDING</p><p></p>

Tweetle Beetle Bottle Battle</h2>
<p>Tweetle beetle bottle battle!" you cry as you round the corner with Snako just behind you. 
</p><p>Aiming your wand at the beetles... nothing happens.</p>
<p>&quot;What are you trying to do?&quot; shouts Snako.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know! I just thought that might work!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's not even magic that's just gibberish!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well I don't see you doing any better, why don't you try to...&quot;</p>
<p>But you never get the chance to tell Snako what he should try to do. Three pops are followed by three blasts of superheated acid.</p>
<p>You try to duck out of the way but you are just a fraction too slow. One splurge of acid grazes your forehead and you fall to the ground, overcome.</p>
<p>Snako hits the ground heavily beside you.</p>
<p>The last thing you see before you lose consciousness is the three giant bombardier beetles doing what appears to be a celebratory dance at the far end of the corridor.</p><p></p>

Defense against Dark Magic</h2>
<p>You decide to go to the Defense Against Dark Magic class next. With Slumblebore warning of danger lurking in the dungeon, you want to be prepared.
</p><p>Professor Madame Blavatsky's classroom is tucked away in an inconspicuous side passage and you almost miss it as you walk past. The inside is much more impressive though, with the floor and walls covered in inky black runes and pictograms, protecting the room against baleful influences.</p>
<p>The professor herself is sitting cross-legged on a little platform at the front of the classroom with her eyes closed while the children file in.</p>
<p>She is a short lady, wearing black robes and, because she is sitting with her legs crossed, looks a little like a large black frog. Her face is pale, almost white, and you can see networks of blue veins under the skin near her temples, like a river draining into a swamp.</p>
<p>As the last child sits down, she opens her eyes.</p>
<p>Her eyeballs gleam white, her irises a brilliant blue.</p>
<p>&quot;Welcome children, to Defence Against Dark Magic. The most important lesson you will learn today is...&quot; Blavatsky's melodious, soothing voice pauses for a moment.</p>
<p>&quot;...control over your own mind. Because it is only when you have full control over yourself that you can hope to resist the control that dark forces may wish to exercise upon you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And what is the path to self control?&quot;</p>
<p>There is silence in the room.</p>
<p>&quot;It is self awareness. It is only by knowing yourself that you can control yourself.&quot;</p>
<p>You look over at Aaron and raise your eyebrows. You were hoping for some good magic spells straight away, not this mumbo jumbo.</p>
<p>&quot;But...&quot; continues Madame Blavatsky, &quot;I sense a doubter in the room. You!&quot; She turns her blue eyes on yours and fixes you in her gaze.</p>
<p>&quot;Have you already mastered yourself young man,&quot; she says to you. &quot;Do you really know who you are?&quot;</p>

Wesley the Weasel</h2>
<p>You reach out a hand to pet the weasel, who allows you to pat him on the head.
</p><p>&quot;Ah, my pet weasel Arthur, do please go ahead and stroke him, by all means. Wesley craves human contact, as long as the human is not from Snakefang house. You see Arthur,&quot; Slumblebore explains as you stroke the weasel, &quot;Wesley was not always a weasel. He was not always called Wesley either. Let me explain.</p>
<p>&quot;Wesley used to be a real boy just like you Arthur. Then one day in an ill-tempered dispute with a Snakefang House student about who had the fastest broomstick, he was transformed by magic into the weasel you see before you. Unfortunately the spell was permanent.&quot;</p>
<p>Wesley listens to all this intently, and he leaps onto Slumblebore's desk, chattering his teeth in rage and frustration.</p>
<p>&quot;As Wesley was an orphan I realised that the kindest thing to do would be to adopt him as my pet. My tailor on Hippotomews specially made his red waistcoat and matching hat. And I decided to give him his new name: Wesley, because Wesley the Weasel has a rather pleasing ring to it, don't you think? His boy name before that was Gary, which would never do. Or possibly it was Barry.</p>
<p>&quot;Ever since then he has lived with me. We get along famously although I must admit that his table manners are not all that they might be - he has an unfortunate habit of defecating in the raisins.&quot;</p>
<p>Wesley hangs his head, shamefacedly.</p>
<p>&quot;But do not let that worry you,&quot; says Slumblebore brightening. &quot;Because every once in a while, I cast a spell to turn all the droppings in the room into raisins. Then they taste virtually identical in any case.</p>
<p>&quot;Why do I tell you all this Arthur? Because I want you to know that for all my students I will always be there for them. I will always be there for you, when you need help the most. Always, Arthur, always. Metaphorically. Just like I was for Barry. Or was it Larry.</p><p></p>

<p>You reach out a hand to pet the weasel, who meekly inclines his head to you and allows himself to be stroked.
</p><p>&quot;Ah yes, I see Wesley likes you!&quot; comments Slumblebore. &quot;I'm not surprised though because he likes all Lionpaw House students: he was once in Lionpaw House himself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I didn't know weasels could study magic in Hogsnorts!&quot; you exclaim.</p>
<p>&quot;They can't, but then Wesley was not always a weasel. He was not always called Wesley either. Let me explain.</p>
<p>&quot;Wesley used to be a real boy just like you Arthur. Then one day in an ill-tempered dispute with a fellow student about who had the fastest broomstick, he was transformed by magic into the weasel you see before you. Unfortunately the spell was permanent.&quot;</p>
<p>Wesley listens to all this intently, and he leaps onto Slumblebore's desk, chattering his teeth in rage and frustration.</p>

<p>&quot;You can easily tell which is which though,&quot; says Slumblebore brightening. &quot;The raisins have a sort of skin to them whereas the droppings are the same texture all the way through.</p>
<p>&quot;Why do I tell you all this Arthur? I want you to know that for all my students I will always be there for them. I will always be there for you, when you need help the most. Always, Arthur, always. Metaphorically. Just like I was for Barry. Or was it Larry.</p><p></p>

Spelling trouble</h2>
<p>"I know I am called Arthur Otley," you say. "But am I defined by my name?"
</p><p>&quot;Excellent point Arthur! I can see by your question that you are already on the path to enlightenment. Because it is only when we realise that we <em>don't</em> know everything that we can learn.&quot;</p>
<p>Madame Blavatsky smiles at you. &quot;And because you are ready to learn I will now teach you your first spell.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But first can anyone tell me,&quot; she says addressing the whole class now, &quot;what is the most common cause of death for wizards and witches? Anyone?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Cave trolls?&quot; suggests Daniel.</p>
<p>&quot;Dragons?&quot; proposes another child.</p>
<p>&quot;Harpies? Banshees? Herpes?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, no and no again.&quot; replies Professor Blavatsky. &quot;I'm afraid that the one thing that is most likely to kill you more than anything else is: each other.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Let me explain. Imagine it is night time, 3am in the morning. You hear a noise downstairs. Immediately you are on the alert. It could be burglars. Or more likely dark wizards on the attack. You creep downstairs, wand at the ready. You can hear them rummaging around in the kitchen. You leap out shouting the most deadly spells you can think of. Only to discover... it is your Uncle Brian who is visiting for the weekend and has come down in the night to help himself to a biscuit. Now he is paralysed on the kitchen floor, a look of horror on his face and the packet of biscuits grasped so tightly in his hand that no-one else will be eating them ever again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes I'm afraid to say that the most common cause of death is 'friendly fire', accidentally hitting your friends and family with dangerous or deadly spells. The sad fact is that you are all in far more danger from each other than from any evil sorcerer. Which is why the spell I am going to teach you to protect against dark magic is a sleeping spell. It is one I designed myself. The benefit of this spell is that it is completely reversible. To wake someone up, you just need to tickle them under their armpits.&quot;</p>
<p>Blavatsky then whips out her wand and points it at Daniel.</p>
<p>&quot;Somnolencia salchicha sabrosa!&quot; she screams.</p>
<p>A dart of pure golden light shoots out of the end of her wand and hits Daniel right in the middle of his forehead. In less than a half a second his head has sunk down to his arms on his desk and he is snoring peacefully.</p>
<p>The class breaks out into a round of applause.</p>
<p>&quot;Make sure you get the pronunciation just right when you cast the spell&quot; Blavatksy advises as she walks over to Daniel and tickles him under the armpits.</p>
<p>&quot;He he he! What happened?&quot; says Daniel, confused.</p>
<p>The class splits into pairs and you practice sending each other to sleep. Because Daniel is still a bit drowsy you go first, pointing your wand at his forehead just as the teacher did:</p>
<p>&quot;Somnolencia salchicha sabrosa...&quot; you repeat carefully.</p>
<p>You feel a wonderful feeling of magical <em>alertness</em> gathering in your tummy. In an instant it has whooshed up out of your arm, channelled by the wand into a golden dart that strikes Daniel on the forehead, for the second time in as many minutes.</p>
<p>In no time at all he is asleep and snoring again.</p>
<p>&quot;I did it!&quot; you shout. &quot;The magic spell worked!&quot;</p>
<p>Delighted with your success you tickle Daniel under the armpits. As he wakes up giggling you try hard to memorise the spell 'Somnolencia salchicha sabrosa' - you never know when it may come in handy.</p><p></p>

Epilogue</h2>
<p>The first kid to step forward is a boy named Snako Malboy from Snakefang house. Azog is perched on your shoulder and hisses in satisfaction as the pale boy approaches nervously. 
</p><p>Snako signs his name in your register and then utters a cry of alarm as Azog leaps onto his neck and sinks his sharp spider fangs into his ear lobe. But it is only to extract a harmless DNA sample from the boy's blood, and when the other children realise this more and more of them approach in the hopes that they too will be made superhuman.</p>
<p>Then the hard work begins.</p>
<p>With Azog, Daniel Colliers Wood and some of the more intelligent Ravenwing students you lock yourselves into a magical laboratory with the childrens' DNA samples. Collecting additional DNA from your insect army it is not long before you have created a powerful hybrid human-insect DNA serum, which you further refine into substrains for isolated traits: wings, antenna, hairy legs and so on.</p>
<p>By the time of school assembly on the following day you are ready.</p>
<p>&quot;Fellow students!&quot; you shout, holding up your hands for silence. &quot;All those who signed up for the human-insect hybridisation program come to front of the hall!&quot;</p>
<p>You instruct them to line up according to whichever insect enhancement they desire: one line for wings, another line for antennae, another for hairy legs and so on.</p>
<p>Each student swallows a magical pill the size and shape of a bluebottle and the transformations begin!</p>
<p>Yells of laughter and delight fill the great hall as the students sprout translucent wings out of their backs, long probing antennae from their foreheads and grow great ugly black hairs on their legs.</p>
<p>In no time at all they are zooming through the air, climbing up the walls and leaping from table to table, reveling in their amazing new powers - the age of the superhuman has begun!</p>
<p>But now it is time for the second - secret - part of your plan.</p>
<p>You and Daniel sneak back to the magical laboratory as the other kids fool around in the great hall. Even Azog doesn't know what you have planned now.</p>
<p>Back at the laboratory you quickly combine the different DNA serums into a single super fluid and mix in two hairs, freshly plucked from each of your heads. The liquid turns electric blue and froths golden bubbles.</p>
<p>You pour it into two matching goblets and hand one to Daniel. Clinking the glasses you look Daniel in the eye.</p>
<p>&quot;See you on the next brain plane.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'll drink to that!&quot; he replies and you both drain your glasses.</p>
<p>The other students and Azog have all of them been deceived. Into each serum you secretly added some termite DNA which has created a hive mind link directly to your and Daniel's brains, activated by your drink.</p>
<p>The brain power of all the children has been added to yours making you and Daniel 100 times cleverer than the cleverest person in human history. As an added bonus, every insect, and each student, is now under your direct control.</p>
<p>Too late the children flying around the Great Hall with their fantastic insect wings realise their predicament and their cries of dismay ring out.</p>
<p>You and Daniel smile at each other, a smile of superman intelligence and understanding. Communicating by pure brainwaves you speak directly into his mind:</p>
<p>&quot;This experiment has been most satisfactory - what shall be our next invention?&quot;</p>
<p>CONGRATULATIONS YOU HAVE ACHIEVED THE SUPERHUMAN MASTERMIND ENDING</p><p></p>

The prophecy</h2>
<p>"Yes there is something I need to talk to you about Arthur, something very important," says Slumblebore. 
</p><p>&quot;Ever since the end of the last school term I have sensed an evil presence in the school. An evil presence that is growing stronger by the day. All that I have been able to determine is that it is coming from the school dungeons. But <em>what</em> it is and <em>where</em> exactly it is down there I do not know. Whatever it is, is beyond my power.&quot;</p>
<p>Slumblebore looks at you directly, his bushy eyebrows waggling.</p>
<p>&quot;This is where you come in Arthur. I need you to investigate what is going on in the dungeon. And deal with it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You want me to go to the dungeon!&quot; you ask, amazed. &quot;But you said at the school dinner that the dungeon was forbidden and no children were to go anywhere near!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes but Arthur don't you see? I can't just go around encouraging all the children to go down into the dungeons. Imagine if anything happened to them? Their parents would take Hogsnorts School to court, the fines could be crippling! No far better if you could just handle this quietly. And don't tell anyone that I told you to go down there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I don't know hardly any magic!&quot; you exclaim, &quot;I've only just started magic school!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I agree you should learn one or two spells before you venture down. Pay attention to your teachers! What they teach you could save your life.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But why me sir? Why not ask one of the older children to do it? Why don't <em>you</em> do it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There is one thing I haven't told you Arthur. In the summer holidays I discovered an ancient prophecy concerning the school. It was written on a scroll that was so old that as soon as I touched it it turned to dust. It said:</p>
<div class="text-poem">
<p>'<em>When darkness falls across your school.
And evil threatens to rise and rule,<br>
When monsters lurk around school ground.
The boy called Arthur must be found.</em>'</p>
</div>
<p>&quot;Your coming has been foretold. If the prophecy is correct, only you can save us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And if you do this thing Arthur,&quot; Slumblebore adds, &quot;I will personally award one million points for Lionpaw House.&quot;</p><p></p>

The Ravenwing House Tower</h2>
<p>You and your new friend Daniel Colliers-Wood join the line of Ravenwing students flocking out of the dining hall. The older Ravenwings lead the way which is just as well as the route is so complicated you would have never found it on your own.
</p><p>Down winding stone staircases that never seem to end. Over sloping flagstones that spiral upward for miles. Across innumerable stone courtyards where your steps echo from the walls.</p>
<p>You pass by magical stained-glass windows in which the colours change over time, making images of dragons breathing flames, or towering magicians leap over tree tops. You walk through dark stone tunnels which are only illuminated by occasional flickering torches.</p>
<p>At last your heart lifts as your weary feet take you to a stone archway framed in the Ravenwing colours of blue and copper.</p>
<p>&quot;We've arrived everyone,&quot; announces a sixth year student from the front of the line. &quot;First years, welcome to your home away from home for the next six years. Everyone else, welcome back! And remember - it is Wingers only who are allowed in here. The tree won't allow anybody else in.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What tree?&quot; you whisper to Daniel. &quot;Is there a tree blocking the way?&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel just shrugs his shoulders, his eyes wide.</p>
<p>Together with the other students you walk under the archway and you notice that the stone is carved in the shape of two intertwined wings. At the top of the arch is a carved-stone raven's head, beak open and pointing downwards.</p>
<p>On the other side of the arch is a stone staircase which you begin to climb.</p>
<p>As you climb you notice something strange: the air smells different, warmer somehow. And the stone steps themselves seem to be becoming softer, their edges smoother.</p>
<p>After a few more turns of the spiral stone staircase you realise that somehow the stone is morphing into a staircase made out of a single piece of wood. But it doesn't seem to be carved wood. Instead it is wood that has <em>grown</em> into this shape.</p>
<p>You keep walking upwards until your legs feel too tired to take another step, when at last you emerge into... a vast timber... room? But this enormous space is made of the same strange flowing, growing wood as the staircase. Then you realise where you are and your jaw drops open.</p>
<p>You and the other Ravenwing students have emerged into the inside of an impossibly giant living tree.</p>
<p>The hollow inside space - the tree trunk - where you are standing soars up seemingly forever. Living wooden ramps and stairs crisscross the space above your head, and you can see doorways scattered in the trunk at different levels. And lining the inside of the tree trunk for as far as you can see are what must be miles and miles of bookshelves, covered in books of every shape and colour imaginable.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur&quot;, says Daniel, &quot;look at all those <em>books</em>!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's right youngsters,&quot; says a kindly looking student a couple of years older than you. &quot;This is the heart of the Ravenwing House Tower and the heart of the tree: the library. This is the largest library in the world. The largest in the magical <em>and</em> non-magical world,&quot; he adds proudly. &quot;Every book that has ever been written and every book that <em>will ever be written</em> is somewhere on these shelves.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But how do you find the one you want among so many?&quot; you ask.</p>
<p>&quot;Easy!&quot; says the boy. &quot;Just watch!&quot;</p>
<p>Shaping a small hole with his lips, he lets out a warbling musical whistle. From high up in the trunk there is an answering warble, and you realise that perched up there is a whole flock of emerald green parrots. One of them flies down to your new companion and lands on his shoulder with a gentle squawk.</p>
<p>&quot;What's your name first year?&quot; the boy asks you with a smile.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur Otley.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ok. Polybius, bring me a book by Arthur Otley.&quot; The parrot launches himself into the air and flies up into the tree trunk.</p>
<p>You realise that Polybius must be the name of the parrot but you don't understand why the boy is asking for a book written by you. &quot;But I haven't written any books,&quot; you explain.</p>
<p>&quot;You mean you haven't written any books <em>yet</em>!&quot; replies the boy. &quot;Remember that this library contains <em>all</em> books including those that will be written in the future.&quot;</p>
<p>With that Polybius the parrot swoops down through the air, and drops a book from his claws into your hands. You look at the cover, which reads: &quot;Adventures with Dragons, by Arthur Otley.&quot;</p>
<p>A huge smile appears on your face. &quot;You mean I will write this?&quot; you ask the boy.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course you will, and if you are not sure <em>what</em> to write, you can just read it to find out.&quot;</p>
<p>As your head spins with possibilities, Daniel tugs on your sleeve. &quot;Hey Arthur, let's go and find our bedrooms.&quot;</p>
<p>You allow Daniel to lead you off up one of the spiralling wooden ramps to a doorway high above the tree trunk floor. Above the doorway is a sign saying &quot;BEDROOMS&quot;.</p>
<p>The doorway leads to a wide wooden corridor which you realise must be the inside of a branch of this great tree. Every now and again to the left and right are doorways with the names of students written above them. After a short while you come across a doorway that says &quot;ARTHUR OTLEY&quot; above it, next to one where the sign says &quot;DANIEL COLLIERS-WOOD&quot;.</p>
<p>You go in and find yourself in a beautiful cosy little living room with some flow-wood armchairs and a sofa, leading to a spacious bathroom and a bedroom. As you go into the bedroom you can see the sun sinking below the horizon through an open window: the grounds of Hogsnorts School are far below you. At the centre of the bedroom is a luxurious circular bed. On top of the pillow is a foil-wrapped mint chocolate and a little raven cuddly toy.</p>
<p>You take off your shoes, throw yourself backwards on the bed and munch on the mint chocolate. Yes I think I can be happy here, you say to yourself, as you drift off to sleep with a smile on your face.</p><p></p>

Jape&#39;s joke time</h2>
<p>You raise your hand and most of the other children do the same. 
</p><p>&quot;Brilliant!&quot; says Professor Jape, &quot;How about this one.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why do aliens find it so much bother to drink a cup of tea?&quot;</p>
<p>You and the other students look politely blank faced.</p>
<p>&quot;Flying saucers!&quot; says Jape with a laugh. &quot;D'you get it? Eh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's a terrible joke!&quot; you whisper to Snako.</p>
<p>&quot;Ok children, next one:</p>
<p>&quot;Why did the toilet paper roll down the stairs of the Snakefang house tower? Come on, any guesses? No?</p>
<p>&quot;To get to the bottom! You know: bottom. Bottom! Your bum! You wipe your bum with toilet paper! Oh you lot are hopeless.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's pretty good actually&quot; Snako whispers to you.</p>
<p>&quot;Right next one. Do you ever file your toe nails? Anyone?&quot; shouts out Professor Jape thoroughly enjoying himself now. &quot;Yes? I don't, I just throw them away! I don't file them, I throw them away, d'you see?&quot;</p>
<p>A few groans and shouts of laughter in the room.</p>
<p>&quot;Who was the fastest runner of all time? Adam, he was the first in the human race!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right, listen to this.&quot; Jape continues. &quot;There was a football match in the jungle. The elephants versus the insects. Eleven a side. The match starts and the elephants are <em>all over</em> the insects. Within five minutes they've already scored two goals. At half time it's 21 nil to the elephants. Then at half time the insects bring on a new player: a centipede. This centipede is <em>amazing!</em>. His feet move so quickly the elephants just can't stop him. In four minutes he's got a hat-trick. In ten minutes he's got a hat-trick of hat-tricks. When the game finishes the insects win 28 goals to 21. Now then, after the game the captain of the elephants goes over to congratulate the captain of the insects on their victory. 'But what I don't understand' he says, 'is why didn't you start the match with the centipede?' 'Well' replies the insect captain, 'we would do but it takes 'im forty-five minutes to get his boots on!'&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Jape bursts into uncontrollable high pitched giggling and lots of the other children laugh too.</p>
<p>&quot;Right children,&quot; says Jape. &quot;That's all we've got time for in this lesson. I hope you had a good laugh, I know I did. See you next time.&quot;</p><p></p>

Epilogue</h2>
<p>The next day all the children are called to the school hall for a special announcement.
</p><p>As you take your seats at the house tables you notice that the ceiling has been enchanted to a beautiful sky blue with fluffy clouds scudding past on one side and a fleet of giant floating zeppelins racing each other on the other.</p>
<p>&quot;Students,&quot; announces Slumblebore from the front of the hall. &quot;I have a very special announcement. Yesterday, unbeknownst to us, we were threatened by a vast and evil insect horde gathering in the school dungeon.&quot;</p>
<p>Slumblebore casts a severe glance at professor Knid, who looks down sheepishly at the table.</p>
<p>&quot;We were saved thanks to the bravery, resourcefulness and pure gumption of one boy.</p>
<p>&quot;That boy is Arthur Otley.&quot;</p>
<p>You feel proud and important as all the students in the school turn round to get a look at you and you hear whispers of &quot;yes that's him&quot;, &quot;defeated the insects single handed!&quot;, &quot;still just a first year!&quot;, and &quot;wouldn't mess with that fella!&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;In recognition of his outstanding services to Hogsnorts School I am pleased to award: one million points to Snakefang House!&quot;</p>
<p>Deafening cheers come from the Snakefang House students all around you.</p>
<p>&quot;Did you hear that?&quot; cries Snako Malboy. &quot;A million points! Last year the Snakefang house only got 500 points for the whole year! Now no-one will be able to beat us to the House Cup!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What is more,&quot; continues Slumblebore, &quot;any unused Snakefang House points will carry over from one year to the next. Which by my calculation means that Snakefang House will win the House Cup for approximately the next... one hundred years.&quot; Slumblebore beams at you through his beard.</p>
<p>&quot;Lastly I hereby announce a new order of wizardry: the Order of the Arthropods. Arthur I grant you first class membership of the Order. Three cheers for Arthur Otley, hero of the school and founding member of the Order of the Arthropods!&quot;</p>
<p>The cheers ring out over and over again. The Snakefang students raise you up on your shoulders and carry you round and round the school hall in triumph shouting &quot;Hooray for Arthur!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wait!&quot; you cry. &quot;Professor Slumblebore, there is one more thing that I demand as my price for saving the school. I want all students, even the lumps in Lionpaw, to repeat after me.&quot;</p>
<p>Slumblebore nods - he knows how much he owes you.</p>
<p>&quot;Snakefang House rules! Yah sssssssss!&quot;</p>
<p>As you stick your tongue out and waggle it from side to side you are delighted to see all the other students in the school copy you.</p>
<p>You are even more delighted to see the expressions of extreme reluctance and distaste on the faces of the Lionpaw students as they repeat the Snakefang House chant, the chant of their oldest enemies.</p>
<p>You savour the sweet taste of victory and sneer at everybody.</p>

Slumblebore&#39;s office</h2>
<p>Slumblebore's office is easy to find, you just follow the signs pointing the way. When you reach it you see that the door is slightly ajar - and there is a light still on inside. Perhaps Slumblebore has gone to bed and forgotten to turn the light out.
</p><p>You motion Kensley to wait outside and she nods vigorously. &quot;Be careful Arthur!&quot; she whispers, &quot;don't leave me on my own for too long!&quot;.</p>
<p>You push on the half open door and immediately hear a voice:</p>
<p>&quot;Come in Arthur.&quot; It's Slumblebore - you've been rumbled!</p>
<p>&quot;Don't worry,&quot; Slumblebore says as if reading your thoughts. &quot;I have been waiting for you to come. I wanted to talk with you.&quot;</p>
<p>You walk into Slumblebore's office and look around you. Every inch of space has been used. Leather bound books on bookshelves line the walls. Paintings with ornate golden frames are hung all around, and ancient Hogsnorts headteachers stare down at you, blinking and sniffing. From the ceiling hang silver cages containing magical golden birds, tiny jewelled monkeys no bigger than your thumb and baby dragons curled up and sleeping. On the floor pentagrams have been marked out in yellow chalk and you almost trip over a live weasel dressed in a little red waistcoat that must be Slumbebore's pet. You resist the urge to stroke its cute little furry head.</p>
<p>Slumblebore himself is sitting behind a massive wooden desk, piled high with manuscripts, scrolls, steaming goblets, plates of watermelon, little bowls of nuts and weasel droppings.</p>
<p>&quot;Care for a raisin?&quot; Slumblebore offers, brushing some weasel droppings onto the floor and proffering you a bowl.</p>
<p>&quot;Err no, thank you,&quot; you reply, not entirely convinced that the bowl is 100% raisins.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur, I'm glad you have come. There is something very serious for us to discuss, which concerns the safety of the entire school. I need your help. But first tell me, how are you settling into the school? Do you feel happy in your new house?&quot;</p><p></p>

Beetle battle</h2>
<p>You find yourself face to face with a trio of bombardier beetles, who seem to be guarding the way. 
</p><p>&quot;Wow look at the size of those things!&quot; says Aaron. &quot;Do you think they are friendly.&quot;</p>
<p>One of them makes an angry chittering sound. Even though you don't speak beetle you are pretty sure this beetle doesn't like you.</p>
<p>The three beetles turn around in the corridor to face away from you.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey look they're running away!&quot; shouts Aaron.</p>
<p>Suddenly there is a loud popping sound and a steam of superheated liquid shoots out of the beetles' bottoms.</p>
<p>&quot;Duck!&quot; you cry, and you and Aaron throw yourself to one side. The liquid misses you by inches. The stone flagstone bubbles and fizzes where the liquid struck it.</p>
<p>You both pick yourself up off the floor and scramble back round the corner for safety.</p>
<p>&quot;That was too close,&quot; you say. &quot;We need to find a way to get past those things.&quot;</p>
<p>You think hard, there must be a spell that you can use. Some spell that puts them out of action for a while so you can sneak past.</p>
<p>After a moment, with grim determination, you decide. You leap out from your hiding place, your wand at the ready.</p><p></p>

Dinner time</h2>
<p>Joining a gang of other Snakefang students you head off on the long winding route back to the Hogsnorts Great Hall to get your dinner.
</p><p>You take a seat at the Snakefang table (after a minor scuffle with some thick headed Lionpaw students) and look around amazed.</p>
<p>Tonight Slumblebore has enchanted the walls and ceiling of the Great Hall to look like the sub-tropical, volcano strewn world of the Jurassic. The effect is made even more magical by enchanting the floor to make it appear as if the Great Hall is strapped to the back of a huge lumbering sauropod - a brontosaurus perhaps - the chairs ensorcelled to vibrate with every lumbering step.</p>
<p>You stare wide eyed at the other giants of the sauropod herd to your left and ride, their long necks stretching forward as you cross an ancient Jurassic plain.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't forget to eat Arthur!&quot; Snako reminds you, elbowing you in the side.</p>
<p>You look down to see yet another incredible feast.</p>
<p>An entire flock of roast swans laid out in a row along the long table. Huge piles of frankfurter sausages, sizzled a beautiful golden brown. Crispy potato chips carved into all manner of spirals, whorls, and helixes. Pears smothered in mayonnaise. Baked bananas wrapped in delicious streaky bacon, stuffed with ketchup. Profiteroles the size of your head, full of light fluffy cream.</p>
<p>It is all so delicious you can't stop an involuntary slobber which you quickly wipe from your chin with the table cloth.</p>
<p>You cram food into your mouth and gulp it down.</p>
<p>When you are full you have a brisk food fight with Lionpaw table, pelting them with profiteroles and bread soaked in gravy - they return the attack with giant strawberries and chicken drumsticks. You shout with laughter when you hit one of the Lionpaw students, a boy called Aaron, full on the face with a giant profiterole and cream explodes everywhere. Snako gets hit in the eye with a boiled potato.</p>
<p>The food fight ends when the dinosaur enchantment on the walls and ceiling suddenly transforms into a battle scene as a gang of huge tyrannosaurus rexes charge from the side at the sauropods that you are riding. You scream and shout with the other students - Slumblebore's enchantment looks so real you can't help ducking as a huge t-rex slashes at you with claws the size of hockey sticks.</p>
<p>Chairs are leaning crazily as the sauropod carrying the Dining Hall tries to evade the ferocious T-Rex attack. The sauropods moan distress cries and fight back with tail whips and neck slams. Several Hedgehog House students vomit on the floor, overcome with fright and motion sickness.</p>
<p>It's complete pandemonium, which ends with the T-Rexes fleeing, defeated but blood dripping from their jaws where they have bitten off hunks of sauropod flesh.</p>
<p>&quot;Snakehouse rules yah ssss!&quot; shouts Snako at the top of his voice at the retreating T-Rexes, overcome with excitement, sticking out his tongue and flapping his hands by the side of his head.</p>
<p>This signals the end of the best dinner you have ever had.</p>
<p>Turning to Snako you say.</p><p></p>

<p>"Let's just walk over the woodlice," you say to Daniel. "I mean, we _are_ about a million times heavier than them. We _should_ just be able to squash them as we go."
</p><p>&quot;I don't know Arthur,&quot; replies Daniel, a look of trepidation in his eyes. &quot;Do you really think it will work?&quot;</p>
<p>In answer you take a determined stride forwards, towards the waiting woodlice hordes. They look back at you from their tiny little compound eyes, their little antenna waving in the air. Daniel sets off behind you.</p>
<p>The first couple of steps pass without mishap. A few of the woodlouse stragglers on the edge of the multitudinous crowd are flattened under the soles of your shoes and you smile, your confidence growing.</p>
<p>But then, as if some kind of telepathic signal passed between the woodlice, in exactly the same moment, there is a whisper of chitin and they simultaneously roll into tight balls - their defensive posture.</p>
<p>You try to stop your forward momentum but it is too late.</p>
<p>Your left foot propels itself through the air and comes down. Onto hundreds and hundreds of little woodlice balls. It is like stepping on a tray of marbles - you don't stand a chance. Your foot rolls on the little balls, grip on the floor hopelessly lost. It shoots forwards and your body shoots backwards - and downwards.</p>
<p>&quot;Aaaargh!&quot; you cry out, landing on the floor with a terrible crash, banging your head. Your fall has crushed to death thousands of woodlice but it is not enough, there are millions more to take their place.</p>
<p>As you slip into unconsciousness, you are vaguely aware of Daniel falling next to you, like a felled tree among the woodlice. You are not sure, but you think you can hear millions of tiny cheers.</p>
<p>Then - everything goes dark.</p><p></p>

Wake up call</h2>
<p>You wake up feeling refreshed and content. You wonder why you are feeling so cheerful and then you remember: you are a pupil in the Hogsnorts school of magic, and have been chosen for the best house - Lionpaw. You have already made a good friend, Aaron Bleezely, and you have your own four-poster bed with an ensuite bathroom. Life is looking good!
</p><p>You jump out of bed and pull on your wizard's robes.</p>
<p>&quot;Aaron&quot; you shout as you walk out onto the staircase, &quot;are you up?&quot;</p>
<p>At that moment you see Aaron running up the stairs towards you in his swimming trunks.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey Arthur, you woke up at last! I've been playing in the waterslides for the last hour. The Lionpaw House Tower is soooo cool. What shall we do today? I know there are lessons but I'm sure no-one will notice if we skip them for a day.&quot;</p><p></p>

Taking cover</h2>
<p>Dashing round the corner you raise your wand and yell "Paraguas pronto!"
</p><p>To your astonishment, from the end of your wand pops out a translucent sparkly golden umbrella.</p>
<p>In a flash it opens up - it is big enough to cover both you and Aaron, which is just as well because in that same moment there is another popping sound and three more splotches of superheated acid from the beetles' bottoms fly through the air towards you.</p>
<p>Splat splat splat!</p>
<p>The acid hits the magical golden umbrella, protecting you from harm.</p>
<p>But not the golden umbrella. In a few moments the acid has dissolved it to nothing, just a little bit of umbrella handle is left poking out of the end of your wand.</p>
<p>The three giant bombardier beetles raise their rear ends at you, and make menacing chittering noises.</p>
<p>&quot;Run away!&quot; shouts Aaron, &quot;We're sitting ducks!&quot;</p>
<p>You both turn back and flee, rounding the corner as more blobs of acid hit the wall behind you.</p>

Jape&#39;s joke time</h2>
<p>You raise your hand and most of the other children do the same. 
</p><p>&quot;Brilliant!&quot; says Professor Jape, &quot;How about this one.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What did the science teacher use to freshen her breath?&quot;</p>
<p>You and the other students look politely blank faced.</p>
<p>&quot;Experimints!&quot; says Jape with a laugh. &quot;D'you get it? Experi-mints?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's a terrible joke!&quot; you whisper to Daniel.</p>
<p>&quot;Ok children, next one:</p>
<p>&quot;Why don't scientists trust atoms?</p>
<p>&quot;Because they make up everything!&quot; Jape laughs uproariously.</p>
<p>&quot;I quite like that one&quot; Daniel whispers to you.</p>
<p>&quot;Right next one. A boy comes up to me, he says: I think my maths teacher loves me. Well why do you think that then? I ask him. Well, he says, she keeps putting little kisses next to all my sums!&quot; Professor Jape bursts out laughing, thoroughly enjoying himself. &quot;D'you see? She keeps on putting kisses by the sums - you know, like crosses, because this little fella keeps getting his sums wrong, hahahaha.&quot;</p>
<p>A few groans and shouts of laughter in the room.</p>
<p>&quot;Right, listen to this.&quot; Jape continues. &quot;There was this fella Nigel who worked in a zoo, mucking out the cages and whatnot. Well one day the orangutan got sick and I'm sorry to say, he died. Now this orangutan was the star attraction, so the owner of the zoo says to this fella: 'Listen Nigel: I want you to dress up in an orangutan suit. The visitors will never know the difference. Without my orangutan star attraction I'm worried the zoo is going to have to close down.' So Nigel put on the orangutan suit and at first felt very self-conscious with all the visitors staring at him and laughing whenever he did anything. But after a while he started to enjoy it, being an orangutan, entertaining the crowd. He started swinging on the ropes going higher and higher, but then... he went too high by mistake and accidentally swung over the wall into the next enclosure - the lion enclosure! Well Nigel was terrified, and the lion - he looked furious. Nigel forgot all about pretending to be an orangutan and started shouting out 'Help! Help! Someone save me!'. The lion gave an almighty roar, and charged over to Nigel. The lion put his face right next Nigel and whispered: 'keep quiet you nincompoop or you'll give us all away!'&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Jape bursts into uncontrollable high pitched giggling and lots of the other children laugh too.</p>
<p>&quot;Right children,&quot; says Jape. &quot;That's all we've got time for in this lesson. I hope you had a good laugh, I know I did. See you next time.&quot;</p><p></p>

Slumblebore&#39;s office</h2>
<p>Slumblebore's office is easy to find, you just follow the signs pointing the way. When you reach it you see that the door is slightly ajar - and there is a light still on inside. Perhaps Slumblebore has gone to bed and forgotten to turn the light out.
</p><p>You motion Aaron to wait outside and he nods vigorously. &quot;Be careful!&quot; he whispers.</p>
<p>You push on the half open door and immediately hear a voice:</p>
<p>&quot;Come in Arthur.&quot; It's Slumblebore - you've been rumbled!</p>
<p>&quot;Don't worry,&quot; Slumblebore says as if reading your thoughts. &quot;I have been waiting for you to come. I wanted to talk with you.&quot;</p>
<p>You walk into Slumblebore's office and look around you. Every inch of space has been used. Leather bound books on bookshelves line the walls. Paintings with ornate golden frames are hung all around, and ancient Hogsnorts headteachers stare down at you, blinking and sniffing. From the ceiling hang silver cages containing magical golden birds, tiny jewelled monkeys no bigger than your thumb and baby dragons curled up and sleeping. On the floor pentagrams have been marked out in yellow chalk and you almost trip over a weasel dressed in a little red waistcoat that must be Slumblebore's pet.</p>
<p>Slumblebore himself is sitting behind a massive wooden desk, piled high with manuscripts, scrolls, steaming goblets, plates of watermelon, little bowls of nuts and weasel droppings.</p>
<p>&quot;Care for a raisin?&quot; Slumblebore offers, brushing some weasel droppings onto the floor and proffering you a bowl.</p>
<p>&quot;Err no, thank you,&quot; you reply, not entirely convinced that the bowl is 100% raisins.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur, I'm glad you have come. There is something very serious for us to discuss, which concerns the safety of the entire school. I need your help. But first tell me, how are you settling into the school? Do you feel happy in your new house?&quot;</p><p></p>

Magical mayhem</h2>
<p>You raise your wand, point it at the woodlice menacingly and shout loudly:
</p><p>&quot;Dispara dinosaurio demente!&quot;</p>
<p>From out of the end of your wand comes a faint but growing roaring sound, like an angry lion. The noise grows louder and louder until it is so loud it hurts your ears.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur, what did you do?&quot; asks Aaron on alarm.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't...&quot; you begin, but before you can finish your sentence, a huge golden dinosaur head somehow <em>forces</em> it's way out of the tip of your wand, and roars again deafeningly.</p>
<p>&quot;ROAR!!!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did I never tell you that I'm terrified of giant angry tyrannosaurus rexes!&quot; yells out Aaron, too petrified to move.</p>
<p>But there's nothing you can do, the spell has been cast. The enormous magical t-rex squeezes its way out of your wand and charges its way towards the woodlice, waggling its ridiculous stunted front legs in a demented fashion.</p>
<p>It launches itself at the nearest woodlouse which has no time to react.</p>
<p>But instead of crushing the woodlouse in its banana sized teeth, the t-rex - impossibly - just bounces off.</p>
<p>It roars and tries again, with the same result.</p>
<p>Then it hits you - woodlice are completely immune to magic.</p>
<p>The dinosaur appears to understand this too. It looks around for a better target. And it's crazy little red eyes fix on you and Aaron.</p>
<p>With a sense of horror you realise that the t-rex is now hunting <em>you</em>!</p>
<p>The rabid dinosaur leaps at you and Aaron but instead of eating you it flings you both into the stone wall on each side and you bump your head painfully. The t-rex stomps up the corridor before disappearing a puff of gold stars as the magic wears off.</p>
<p>As you slide down the wall and into unconsciousness, you can see the millions of woodlice waving their little antennae. As you close your eyes you think: are they laughing?</p><p></p>

Inner peace</h2>
<p>"I'm Arthur Otley and I want to learn some spells" you say to Professor Blavatsky.
</p><p>&quot;Ah so impatient. And yet this impatience stops you learning about yourself. I can see that you are very far from self control as yet.&quot;</p>
<p>The teacher stands up and raises one hand.</p>
<p>&quot;But do not worry, any of you. Because we will start with a simple meditation session to help you gain control.&quot;</p>
<p>You groan inwardly. This sounds boring.</p>
<p>&quot;Close your eyes everyone,&quot; begins Professor Blavatsky. &quot;Make sure you are comfortable in your seats. Now I want you to focus on your breathing. Breathe in. Breathe out. Breathe in... and breathe out.</p>
<p>&quot;Feel the breath flowing into your nostrils. Concentrate on the sensation. Do you feel your nose hairs tickling? Perhaps a small bogey flapping around in your nasal passage? Just think about the breath, how it feels.&quot;</p>
<p>Despite yourself you feel your awareness sharpening, and you do indeed feel a small bogey in your nostril wobbling around as you breathe in and out.</p>
<p>&quot;Now I want you to think about a special number. The special number is 42. A four and then a two. Forty two. This number is not just a number it is also a place. A location. A place of calm that you can always turn to in moments of difficulty or stress.</p>
<p>&quot;This number 42 is a place within yourself, but it is a real place too that anyone can reach, if they just turn to that number... the number 42. As you turn to 42, just keep your thumb here so you know where to come back to.&quot;</p>
<p>Amazingly you feel a sensation as if you are floating somehow, except with your thumb stuck down in front of you. Concentrating fiercely you try with all your might to turn to 42. You float away...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&quot;Did anyone manage to meditate and reach 42?&quot; asks Madam Blavatsky.</p>
<p>You definitely feel you went... somewhere. You <em>think</em> this is what Professor Blavatsky meant.</p>
<p>&quot;Any time you find yourself in need of quiet and peace, just repeat this meditation exercise and think of the number 42 and you will find a place of calm and relaxation - but keep your thumb right where you are and you will be able to turn back whenever you want.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Class dismissed! We will meet again.&quot;</p><p></p>

Another chance</h2>
<p>The clock strikes one... two... three.
</p><p>The golden glow shining all around you gets stronger and stronger and soon you have to shut your eyes to the blinding golden light.</p>
<p>After a momentary sensation of vertigo, as if you have all of a sudden <em>fallen</em>, you sense that the golden light is fading away.</p>
<p>Opening your eyes you find you are at the bottom of a great stone well, with a circle of light far above. You realise that you have magically transported back to Percy the Picking Pigeon's hole in the Hogsnort's Great Hall, just as Slumblebore said you would. Somehow you know that you have also travelled back in time to before, when you had just arrived at the school. You are that Arthur once again in Percy's hole, but this time you can make a new choice.</p>
<p>&quot;Well Arthur,&quot; says a voice directly to your brain. &quot;What will you choose, coo coo.&quot; It is Percy the giant pigeon and you see again his giant yellow eyes staring at you.</p>

Bunking off</h2>
<p>"Yeah we're in Snakefang House now, we can do whatever we like!" you say, as the two of you head down to the lava pool.
</p><p>As you arrive in the central courtyard the other Snakefang students are leaving for your lessons, but not before one of them has explained to you that the lava pool is one end of a pipe that goes through the earth's crust directly down to the mantle 70 km below. Magically constructed by Sylvester Snakefang all those centuries ago with a knowledge that is now lost, it still serves as the central heating and waste disposal system of the Tower.</p>
<p>This gives you an idea, and you and Snako go back to your towers and return with an armful of food from your everlasting larders. You make a little pile of this next to the lava pool and take turns throwing stuff in and watching it burn. You particularly enjoy watching the chocolate frogs melting to a gloop and then bursting into flames.</p>
<p>When you get bored of this you play with the snakes. They don't speak but they appear to understand everything you say, and soon you are playing tag, running and yelling with the snakes in hot pursuit.</p>
<p>Then you discover another doorway leading to a cavernous rock chamber full of indoor tennis and badminton courts and table tennis tables. You and Snako play a few rounds of table tennis leading to a two-all draw.</p>
<p>After another trip to the inexhaustible larder you decide to climb up the winding stone staircase to the very top of the house tower. When you reach the summit your legs feel like they can't take another step but you are rewarded with a view for miles and miles - hills and mountains and forests, with no buildings other than those of Hogsnorts in sight.</p>
<p>You and Snako amuse yourselves by throwing things off the edge and watching them fall.</p>
<p>Finally you both go and chill out in your own tower, playing video games in which you run around shooting at each other.</p>
<p>It has been the best day ever.</p>

<p>From the golden filaments in the roof, a flutter of beautiful golden snowflakes fall. Each one has an exquisitely perfect hexagonal symmetry.</p>
<p>When they land on your arms and head, they give you a warm tingling sensation and then disappear with a tinkling sound, like a tiny bell.</p>

Wesley the Weasel</h2>
<p>You cautiously reach out a hand to pet the weasel, who allows you to pat him gently on the head.
</p><p>&quot;Ah, you like my pet weasel do you? You like to pat him? Good: Wesley could do with a little affection now and again, couldn't you Wesley hmmm? You see Arthur,&quot; Slumblebore explains as you pat away, &quot;Wesley was not always a weasel. He was not always called Wesley either. Let me explain.</p>
<p>&quot;Wesley used to be a real boy just like you Arthur. Then one day in an ill-tempered dispute with a fellow student about who had the fastest broomstick, he was transformed by magic into the weasel you see before you. Unfortunately the spell was permanent.&quot;</p>
<p>Wesley listens to all this intently, and he leaps onto Slumblebore's desk, chattering his teeth in rage and frustration.</p>
<p>&quot;As Wesley was an orphan I realised that the kindest thing to do would be to adopt him as my pet. My tailor on Hippotomews specially made his red waistcoat and matching hat. And I decided to give him his new name: Wesley, because Wesley the Weasel has a rather pleasing ring to it, don't you think? His boy name before that was Gary, which would never do. Or possibly it was Barry.</p>
<p>&quot;Ever since then he has lived with me. We get along famously although I must admit that his table manners are not all that they might be - he has an unfortunate habit of defecating in the raisins.&quot;</p>
<p>Wesley hangs his head, shamefacedly.</p>
<p>&quot;You can easily tell which is which though,&quot; says Slumblebore brightening. &quot;The raisins have a smooth feel, whereas the droppings are more squishy. Unless Wesley has constipation - in which case they are crunchy.</p>
<p>&quot;Why do I tell you all this Arthur? Because I want you to know that for all my students I will always be there for them. I will always be there for you, when you need help the most. Always, Arthur, always. Metaphorically. Just like I was for Barry. Or was it Larry.</p><p></p>

<p>&quot;Just think Arthur. Together we could achieve so much. You, the chosen one with your one-of-a-kind wand and me with all the armies of the arthropods at my command! We could do anything. We could do everything!&quot;</p>
<p>While Azog is talking he is getting steadily closer and closer to you. You find yourself mesmerised by his eight tiny compound eyes.</p>
<p>Perhaps you <em>should</em> take a stand, remake the world with Azog and the insect hordes, take over the school... on the other hand if you were to stop Azog now you would be a hero and would surely win the house cup for Hedgehog House - didn't Slumblebore promise you a million points?</p>
<p>&quot;You must choose now Arthur,&quot; says Azog quietly. &quot;Are you with me? Or against me?&quot;</p><p></p>

Knid&#39;s spell</h2>
<p>You sit still not wanting to encourage the professor, and none of the other students wants to disagree with him either. 
</p><p>&quot;Good. Good.&quot; says Professor Knid. &quot;Now we are all agreed, I can tell you that today we will be studying the marvellous woodlouse. Flies, deliver the woodlice!&quot;</p>
<p>At this command, a hundred or so flies detach themselves from Knid's cape, zoom over to a box on the professor's desk and pick up the woodlice, one between four flies. The flies then carry one woodlice to each student and drop it onto the desk in front of them. The flies buzz back to Professor Knid and reattach themselves to his cloak.</p>
<p>The little woodlouse on your desk appears disturbed at this unexpected flight. It takes one look at you then rolls up into a ball.</p>
<p>&quot;Now can anyone move their woodlouse using a magic spell?&quot; asks Knid. &quot;Try any magic spell that you know.&quot;</p>
<p>You raise your wand, point it at the woodlouse and mumble &quot;abracadabra&quot; rather hopefully.</p>
<p>You are delighted to see a little sparkle of gold stars shoot out of the end of your wand. The sparkles hit the woodlouse... and bounce right off! The woodlouse is unmoved.</p>
<p>Looking around the classroom you can see that the other children are having no more success than you did.</p>
<p>Snako singed his own eyebrows when his lightning spell bounced off the woodlouse and hit him in the face. Kensley Potato's ice spell has frozen her desk into a solid block of ice but not touched the woodlouse. Brian Banana (another student from Hedgehog) has tried to make his woodlouse disappear but accidentally lost his wand in the process.</p>
<p>&quot;The woodlouse, children, as you are discovering, is completely impervious to magic. So if you want to move the woodlouse you must first <em>understand</em> the woodlouse. And the one thing that scares the woodlouse more than anything else is drying out. As soon as they lose their moisture they die. Now - look at this.&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Knid raises his wand in an impressively expansive gesture and recites: &quot;Fiel fresa fusila fuego!&quot;</p>
<p>A large flame whooshes out of the end of his wand and starts to bake the air around the woodlouse on his desk. Terrified of being dried out, the woodlouse unrolls and scuttles away as fast as he can.</p>
<p>&quot;So we can see that <em>indirect</em> magic can be powerful against even magic resistant creatures. And we didn't have to harm any arthropods in the process. Now children it's your turn. Wands at the ready!&quot;</p>
<p>You look down at your cowering woodlouse and, aiming with your wand, recite the words of the spell:</p>
<p>&quot;Fiel fresa fusila fuego!&quot;</p>
<p>From the tips of your fingers to the ends of your toes you can feel a powerful magic charge building in your body. It concentrates in your chest and then zooms along your arm and out of your wand in a very impressive jet of flame.</p>
<p>You are overjoyed at the result, the first time you have cast such a powerful spell. Just think what you could do with such magic! Just imagine how frightened people will be of your powers!</p>
<p>The woodlouse feels the magical flames heat the air and desk around him, and scarpers.</p>
<p>&quot;I did it!&quot; you cry, and commit the words of the spell to your memory: fiel fresa fusila fuego.</p><p></p>

<p>&quot;I... I... I think I don't want to leave Hedgehog just yet,&quot; you stammer. You are not quite sure why you changed your mind at the last minute, but it just didn't feel... right.</p>

Mirror mirror on the walls</h2>
<p>You and Aaron decide to investigate the nearest stone staircase. From the bottom all you can see is that it winds up to some shadowy and little visited part of the school. 
</p><p>At the top of the stone stairs, you encounter a passageway lined with suits of armour. The empty helmets are turned in your direction and twist to follow you and Aaron as you walk past. Even though you know they are just regular suits of enchanted magical armour the effect is rather creepy.</p>
<p>At the end of the corridor there is a single door which swings open on silent hinges at your touch.</p>
<p>The room inside is small, dark and bare - but not quite empty.</p>
<p>Next to one wall there is a mirror, with the words above it 'Look at me if you dare, you will see your soul laid bare'.</p>
<p>Opposite, against another wall there's <em>another</em> mirror. Above this one it says 'Stare at me and you will see, what you want to come to be.'</p>
<p>Aaron relaxes. &quot;I know what these are! They're mirrors of desire. They show you what you most want in your whole life, maybe even something you didn't even realise. My mum's got one of those in the downstairs toilet.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's amazing!&quot; you breathe, and step up in front of one of the mirrors nervously.</p>
<p>You look at your reflection in the mirror and see...</p>
<p>...a taller, more handsome version of yourself. You are festooned with gold medals from the Olympics, and people keep approaching you from the side of the mirror to take your photo. Your hair is styled into a quiff and you are grinning with a fine set of bright white teeth.</p>
<p>&quot;Wow look at me, I look so cool!&quot;</p>
<p>Then you catch the reflection of the mirror behind you in the mirror in front of you - the reflection of the reflection.</p>
<p>In <em>that</em> reflection you are quietly reading a book sitting on a comfortable armchair with a fluffy dog at your feet.</p>
<p>&quot;That's funny,&quot; you say. &quot;The reflection of my reflection in the mirror behind me doesn't look cool at all...&quot;</p>
<p>Then it dawns on you.</p>
<p>That gold medal champion version of yourself doesn't <em>want</em> all that fame and attention, he's tired of it - <em>I</em> would be tired of it. What you are seeing is the cool version of you's most earnest desire - which is for a quiet life, reading a book, with just a faithful dog as a companion.</p>
<p>You angle your head to catch more reflections of reflections and see the images of yourself curve away into infinity.</p>
<p>With each reflection's reflection the cool version of yourself is just that little bit less cool and the quiet version of yourself becomes a little bit less quiet. Far into the depths of the mirrors you can just make out an Arthur just like yourself, waving back at you.</p>
<p>You shake your head, confused, and tell Aaron what you saw.</p>
<p>&quot;That's it!&quot; he says. &quot;Don't you see? The person you really want to be, when you get right down to it, is yourself.&quot;</p><p></p>

<p>Making sure that you have got all of your quills, ink bottles, spell books and sweets, you put your bag on your shoulder and leave the Great Hall to go back to the House Tower with Snako.
</p><p>Strangely enough you find you can remember the way back there easily - the path had seemed so long and winding on your first day. Perhaps it was something to do with eating the Snakefang Egg from Percy the Picking Pigeon that has given you a homing instinct for the Tower.</p>
<p>When you arrive you head straight to the Snakefang house sauna and get a wonderful massage from one of the giant snakes, who slithers around on your back while you lie down.</p>

The prophecy</h2>
<p>"Yes there is something I need to talk to you about Arthur, something very important," says Slumblebore. 
</p><p>&quot;Ever since the end of the last school term I have sensed an evil presence in the school. An evil presence that is growing stronger by the day. All that I have been able to determine is that it is coming from the school dungeons. But <em>what</em> it is and <em>where</em> exactly it is down there I do not know. Whatever it is, is beyond my power.&quot;</p>
<p>Slumblebore peers at you closely, his bushy eyebrows raised.</p>
<p>&quot;This is where you come in Arthur. I need you to investigate what is going on in the dungeon. And deal with it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You want me to go to the dungeon!&quot; you ask, amazed. &quot;But you said at the school dinner that the dungeon was forbidden and no children were to go anywhere near!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes but Arthur don't you see? I can't just go around encouraging all the children to go down into the dungeons. There would be a stampede! And imagine if anything happened to them? Their parents would take Hogsnorts School to court, the fines could be crippling! No far better if you could just handle this quietly. And don't tell anyone that I told you to go down there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I know very little magic!&quot; you exclaim, &quot;I've only just started magic school!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I agree you should learn one or two spells before you venture down. Pay attention to your teachers! What they teach you could save your life.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But why me sir? Why not ask one of the older children to do it? Why don't <em>you</em> do it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There is one more thing I haven't told you Arthur. In the summer holidays I discovered an ancient prophecy concerning the school. It was written on a scroll that was so old that as soon as I touched it it turned to dust. It said:</p>
<div class="text-poem">
<p>'<em>When darkness falls across your school.
And evil threatens to rise and rule,<br>
When monsters lurk around school ground.
The boy called Arthur must be found.</em>'</p>
</div>
<p>&quot;Your coming has been foretold. If the prophecy is correct, only you can save us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And if you do this thing Arthur,&quot; Slumblebore adds, &quot;I will personally award one million points for Ravenwing House.&quot;</p><p></p>

Professor Eric Knid Explains</h2>
<p>A voice, strong and commanding, emerges from the darkness. "You? The saviour, a mere stripling first year? Impossible!"  
</p><p>Another voice, high pitched and chittery, answers him. &quot;Yes Eric, this is him. He is the wand holder.&quot;</p>
<p>As your eyes adjust to the gloom, you can make out a figure standing in the centre of the room. A wizard - and one you recognise.</p>
<p>&quot;Professor Knid!&quot; you exclaim.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes Professor Eric Knid at your service! Or perhaps I should say that you will be at my service... Arthur isn't it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes my name's Arthur. Arthur Otley.&quot; A sensation of fear congeals in your throat. &quot;What do you mean? And who were you talking to just now?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All in good time, Arthur...&quot; with an unexpectedly swift movement Professor Knid draws his wand and shoots a spell of locking at the iron gate which clangs shut.</p>
<p>You are trapped.</p>
<p>&quot;What are you going to do?&quot;</p>
<p>Eric Knid smiled. Even in the dark you can see the mad gleam in his eye: &quot;Revolution!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Explain why Eric.&quot; That chittering voice again, appearing out of nowhere.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes - why. Why? Ever since I was a young boy Arthur I have felt an affinity with insects, spiders, crabs. With the Arthropods. A dog will bite you, not so an earwig! A lion may eat you, not so a woodlouse! A human may betray you, a spider will not.</p>
<p>&quot;My faithful friends growing up were slugs, ants, flies and beetles. But my friends were mercilessly crushed, poisoned, and swatted by humans.</p>
<p>&quot;The final straw? Slumblebore sat on a spider - and laughed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I couldn't bear it. I sought out the Great Spider King Azog himself. What joy when I found him in the forbidden bushes and entered his service. Together we have been gathering supporters here in this dungeon, insects and spiders in their millions. For revenge. For a revolution. To take over the school!</p>
<p>&quot;No longer will it just be Lionpaw House, Ravenwing House, Snakefang House, and Hedgehog House! We will have a new house mightier than all of them. The Order of the Arthropods! And I will be headmaster.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But why me?&quot; fear chills you. &quot;What has this got to with me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are the only one who can stop us Arthur,&quot; says the mysterious high pitched voice. &quot;But with you on our side we will be invincible!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who is that?&quot; you cry.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the Great Spider King Azog himself. And you are honoured to stand in his presence.&quot; Professor Knid explains.</p>
<p>&quot;Where?&quot; You can't see anyone other than the Professor.</p>
<p>&quot;Here!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where, I can't see!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right here, look! Closer!&quot;</p><p></p>

<p>1. You look closer. ~ <strong>Go to number 106</strong></p>

<h2 class="text-centre" id="178">178. <br>
The Order of the Athropods</h2>
<p>You hold out your hand to Azog and he puts his tiny spider legs on the tip of your finger. Looking into your eyes, he nods his head and climbs up onto your hand then up your arm and onto your shoulder.
</p><p>&quot;Wait - what?&quot; enquires Daniel looking troubled.</p>
<p>&quot;Trust me,&quot; you tell him. &quot;I have a clever idea.&quot;</p>
<p>Azog is not troubled at all, he is delighted that you have joined him.</p>
<p>&quot;Athropods, prepare yourselves!&quot; shouts out Azog from his position on your shoulder. Out of the walls and ceiling untold millions of insects emerge, each one pitifully small but together forming a huge unstoppable army.</p>
<p>&quot;Today we have a new leader! He is the chosen one whose coming to the dungeon was foretold. He stands here before you: Arthur Otley!&quot;</p>
<p>Marvelling at the hordes of insects at your command you feel amazed and excited. You realise that the insects of the world  <em>do</em> deserve justice. You wonder what they are capable of and how easy they will be to control - or not.</p>
<p>&quot;For too long has the insect world been downtrodden - literally - in this school,&quot; you say. &quot;From now on there will be a new house, above the four houses of Lionpaw, Ravenwing, Snakefang and Hedgehog. It will be a new Order standing aside from all the rest! The Order of the Arthropods! Our purpose will be human-insect harmony but first... we must earn the respect of the school.&quot;</p>
<p>At the head of the insect army you, Daniel and Azog pour out of the dungeon and into the school.</p>
<p>You stride into Slumblebore's office with Azog on your shoulder and millions of insects crawling on the floor, walls and ceiling just behind you.</p>
<p>Slumblebore is inside and you explain to him that there are about to be some big changes around here, and with a vast insect army behind you there is nothing he can do to stop them.</p>
<p>With a defeated sigh Slumblebore agrees to your demands.</p>
<p>The next morning Slumblebore calls a general assembly of the school and reads out your demands. The insect army is hidden in cracks in the walls but ready to leap out if necessary.</p>
<p>&quot;Firstly&quot; Slumblebore begins, &quot;No one must squash, damage or belittle an insect, unless it is for the purpose of magical study.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Secondly there will be a new House, the Order of the Arthropods, which will take precedence over all other houses, and even over myself as headmaster. Arthur Otley is the head of the Order of the Arthropods and he will rule for life. Daniel Colliers-Wood is second in command.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thirdly, a new program of insect-human magical hybridisation will begin. A tribe of new super-children will be formed. Anyone wishing to be enhanced with magical insect powers must provide a DNA sample to Arthur or Daniel at the end of this assembly.&quot;</p>
<p>There are murmurs of surprise and shock. The students realise that nothing will be the same again - the Order of the Arthropods has begun!</p><p></p>

</p><p>You notice a disgusting little spider running around a corner ahead of you. Curiously it then comes back round the corner, looks at you and waits, then lifts up a spindly leg and points.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur&quot; says Snako, &quot;I think that spider wants us to follow him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think we should just squash it,&quot; you suggest. &quot;Disgusting little thing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No listen,&quot; Snako restrains you. &quot;It may be a magical creature - it may be an <em>evil</em> magical creature.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh ok fine, I won't squash it... yet. Let's see where it goes.&quot;</p>
<p>You follow the spider as it turns this way then that and are delighted to finally arrive at what must surely be the entrance to the dungeon.</p>
<p>A huge wooden door, banded with silver inlaid iron, stands within a stone archway. Either side of the door two antique sets of armour are positioned upright as if on guard.</p>
<p>The spider you were following scurries through the keyhole of the door and disappears.</p>
<p>&quot;It's got away the little blighter!&quot; you exclaim.</p>
<p>&quot;Never mind that Arthur, look where we are!&quot; shouts Snako, forgetting to be quiet in his excitement.</p>
<p>Above the door there is a sign written in some archaic font, which reads: &quot;DUNGEON&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes!&quot; you breathe, &quot;We've finally found it.&quot;</p>
<p>You try the doorknob but it doesn't budge.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a magical enchantment of locking on the door!&quot; says Snako. &quot;We will need to cast a counter spell if we are to get through.&quot;</p>
<p>As you lift up your wand, you rack your brains to try to think of a spell that might work.</p><p></p>

Jape&#39;s joke time</h2>
<p>You raise your hand and most of the other children do the same. 
</p><p>&quot;Brilliant!&quot; says Professor Jape, &quot;How about this one.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What's the noisiest pet?&quot;</p>
<p>You and the other students look politely blank faced.</p>
<p>&quot;A trumpet!&quot; says Jape with a laugh. &quot;D'you get it? Trum-pet? Eh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I like that one!&quot; you whisper to Kensley.</p>
<p>&quot;Ok children, next one:</p>
<p>&quot;What kind of key opens a banana? Come on, any guesses? No?</p>
<p>&quot;A monkey! You know: a mon-key! A mon key? No? Oh you lot are hopeless.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I like bananas&quot; Kensley whispers to you.</p>
<p>&quot;Right next one. What's the tastiest table?&quot; shouts out Professor Jape thoroughly enjoying himself now. &quot;A vegtable! Ha ha ha ha! A veg-table&quot;</p>
<p>A few groans and shouts of laughter in the room.</p>
<p>&quot;What room has no doors! A mushroom!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right, listen to this.&quot; Jape continues. &quot;One day a baby was born, a lovely little baby, and his mum and dad were over the moon. He was a perfectly normal, happy little baby except for one thing - he had a belly button made out of solid gold.</p>
<p>Well the doctors looked at it but they had never seen anything like it before. Don't worry, they told the parents, he's a healthy little chap and the golden belly button doesn't seem to be doing any harm.</p>
<p>Now as this boy grew up he became curious about this golden belly button of his. Why did he have it? What did it mean? Why was it golden? He asked everyone he could but no-one knew: not his teachers at school, not the chief of police, not even the top professors at Oxbridge university. But one day he heard about the wisest man in the world who lived at the top of the tallest mountain far away in the Himalayas.</p>
<p>So got an aeroplane all the way to India, a bus to the foot of the mountain, a donkey halfway up the mountain, and from there he had to walk, hour after hour in the freezing cold, until he was high above the clouds but still he wasn't at the top. Finally though he reached the top and on the peak was a beautiful temple and sitting in the middle of the temple with his eyes closed was an old man with a great white beard reaching down to his knees.</p>
<p>Oh wisest man, said the boy, can you tell me why I have this golden belly button? And the wise old man opened his eyes in wonder and said for many years have I waited for this moment. And from a chain around his neck he held up a golden key. This golden key was exactly the same colour golden as the boy's golden belly button.</p>
<p>The wise old man put the gold key into the golden belly button and it fitted perfectly. Slowly he turned the key.</p>
<p>Then... the boy's bum fell off.&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Jape bursts into uncontrollable high pitched giggling and some of the other children laugh too.</p>
<p>&quot;His bum, it fell right off!&quot; shrieked Professor Jape. &quot;He went all that way and then his bum fell off! Oh that's a good one that is!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right children,&quot; says Jape. &quot;That's all we've got time for in this lesson. I hope you had a good laugh, I know I did. See you next time.&quot;</p><p></p>

</p><p>But he has spoken too soon. The magic you have activated doesn't open the door instead it sets off a piercing alarm! An enchanted recording of Slumblebore's voice shouts out:</p>
<p>&quot;Intruders! Intruders! Beware, intruders are trying to get into the dungeon! Stop them! Intruders! Intruders!&quot;</p>
<p>Over and over again, the voice of Slumblebore cries out.</p>

<p>You and Daniel dash madly back to the Ravenwing House tower, skidding round corners and leaping up stairs three at a time, the voice shouting out behind you.</p>

A silly idea</h2>
<p>"Tonto tijeras trae tiempo!" you shout out, waving your wand above your head.
</p><p>To your surprise, a golden pair of magical scissors shoots out of the end of your wand and strikes the ceiling, and golden threads arch through the stone above your head.</p>
<p>From the golden filaments in the roof, a flutter of beautiful golden snowflakes fall. Each one has an exquisitely perfect hexagonal symmetry.</p>
<p>When they land on your arms and head, they give you a warm tingling sensation and then disappear with a tinkling sound, like a tiny bell.</p>
<p>After a few moments the golden snow fall stops and the corridor returns to its previous gloomy state.</p>

Spelling trouble</h2>
<p>"I know I am called Arthur Otley," you say. "But is my name who I really am?"
</p><p>&quot;Excellent point Arthur! I can see by your question that you are already on the path to enlightenment. Because it is only when we realise that we <em>don't</em> know everything that we can learn.&quot;</p>
<p>Madame Blavatsky smiles at you. &quot;And because you are ready to learn I will now teach you your first spell.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But first can anyone tell me,&quot; she says addressing the whole class now, &quot;what is the most common cause of death for wizards and witches? Anyone?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Broomstick failure?&quot; suggests Kensley.</p>
<p>&quot;Poisoned potions?&quot; proposes another child.</p>
<p>&quot;Manitees? Dragons? Ghouls?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, no and no again.&quot; replies Professor Blavatsky. &quot;The one thing that is most likely to kill you more than anything else is: each other.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Let me explain. Imagine it is night time, 3am in the morning. You hear a noise downstairs. Immediately you are on the alert. It could be burglars. Or more likely dark wizards on the attack. You creep downstairs, wand at the ready. You can hear them rummaging around in the kitchen. You leap out shouting the most deadly spells you can think of. Only to discover... it is your Uncle Brian who is visiting for the weekend and has come down in the night to help himself to a biscuit. Now he is paralysed on the kitchen floor, a look of horror on his face and the packet of biscuits grasped so tightly in his hand that no-one else will be eating them ever again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes I'm afraid to say that the most common cause of death is 'friendly fire', accidentally hitting your friends and family with dangerous or deadly spells. The sad fact is that you are all in far more danger from each other than from any evil sorcerer. Which is why the spell I am going to teach you to protect against dark magic is a sleeping spell. It is one I designed myself. The benefit of this spell is that it is completely reversible. To wake someone up, you just need to tickle them under their armpits.&quot;</p>
<p>Blavatsky then whips out her wand and points it at Kensley.</p>
<p>&quot;Somnolencia salchicha sabrosa!&quot; she screams.</p>
<p>A dart of pure golden light shoots out of the end of her wand and hits Kensley right in the middle of his forehead. In less than a half a second her head has sunk down to her arms on his desk and she is snoring like a sailor.</p>
<p>The class breaks out into a round of applause.</p>
<p>&quot;Make sure you get the pronunciation just right when you cast the spell&quot; Blavatksy advises as she walks over to Kensley and tickles her under the armpits.</p>
<p>&quot;Ha ha ha! What happened?&quot; says Kensley, confused.</p>
<p>The class splits into pairs and you practice sending each other to sleep. Because Kensely is still a bit drowsy you go first, pointing your wand at her forehead just as the teacher did:</p>
<p>&quot;Somnolencia salchicha sabrosa...&quot; you repeat carefully.</p>
<p>You sense an unnerving feeling of magical power gathering in your tummy. In an instant it has whooshed up out of your arm, channelled by the wand into a golden dart that zaps Kensely on the head, for the second time in as many minutes.</p>
<p>In no time at all she is asleep and snoring again.</p>
<p>&quot;I did it!&quot; you shout. &quot;It worked!&quot;</p>
<p>Delighted with your success you tickle Kensley under the armpits. As she wakes up giggling you try hard to memorise the spell 'Somnolencia salchicha sabrosa' - you never know when it may come in handy.</p><p></p>

Knid&#39;s insects</h2>
<p>You raise your hand and ask "Aren't hedgehogs better than insects? They eat insects don't they."
</p><p>&quot;What an awful little squeaker you are! Hedgehogs! Pah! No boy, hedgehogs are <em>not</em> better than insects.</p>
<p>&quot;Firstly: hedgehogs can't fly but insects can. Insects have been flying for over 350 million years! And to think we are always <em>so impressed</em> by the birds. Look at me, look at my feathers, I'm a bird! But insects have been flying for twice as long as birds - birds only evolved 150 million years ago. Pathetic.</p>
<p>&quot;Secondly: a hedgehog may eat an insect, but after a hedgehog dies who has the last laugh? Insects that's who. Insects, working together will devour the hedgehog carcass until nothing is left, not even the bones. If it wasn't for insects we would have dead hedgehogs all over the place - you would be tripping over them every time you went out of your front door!</p>
<p>&quot;Thirdly: how many hedgehogs are there in the world? Not many I can tell you. Or how many mammals even? All the hedgehogs, deer, humans, rabbits and elephants put together?</p>
<p>Mammals make up only 0.4% of all animal species.</p>
<p>Insects species make up 70% of all animal species, and if we include all arthropods that's over 80%. That means for every one mammal species (like a hedgehog) there are <em>more than 170 insect species</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;No, it is clear to me, as it should now be clear to you, that hedgehogs are pitiful, almost inconsequential creatures compared to insects and arthropods.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But sir,&quot; interrupts Kensley, &quot;insects <em>are</em> disgusting...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh the cheek of it! Who is to say that you are not a disgusting young lady with your.... goggly eyes and grubby fingers? There will come a day - and maybe sooner than you think - when everyone will appreciate the magnificence of an insect, when people don't shudder when I brush past them with my cloak. Yes you will appreciate those 'disgusting' insects soon enough my girl.&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Jape paused and pinched the bridge of his nose with two fingers. &quot;Class dismissed. Your homework is to write an essay with the title 'What I love most about insects and arthropods'. Two thousand words minimum.&quot;</p><p></p>

The dungeon door</h2>
<p>You enter the passageway sloping downwards and after many twists and turns in the passageway you are hopelessly lost.
</p><p>You notice a fascinating little spider running around a corner ahead of you - possibly a member of the <em>paratropididae</em> spider family. Curiously it then comes back round the corner, looks at you and waits, then lifts up a spindly leg and points.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur&quot; says Daniel, &quot;I think that spider wants us to follow him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Truly remarkable,&quot; you reply. &quot;It appears to be demonstrating significantly more intelligent behaviour than the average spider. Let's see where it is going.&quot;</p>
<p>You follow the spider as it turns this way then that and are amazed and delighted to finally arrive at what must surely be the entrance to the dungeon.</p>
<p>&quot;This is it Daniel,&quot; you say. &quot;We've found it!&quot;</p>

Balls up</h2>
<p>"Let's just walk over the woodlice," you say to Snako. "I mean, we _are_ about a million times heavier than them. We _should_ just be able to squash them as we go."
</p><p>&quot;I don't know Arthur,&quot; replies Snako, a look of fear in his eyes. &quot;Do you really think it will work?&quot;</p>
<p>In answer you take a determined stride forwards, towards the waiting woodlice hordes. They look back at you (do they have eyes?) their little antenna waving in the air. Snako sets off behind you with a little whimper.</p>
<p>The first couple of steps pass without mishap. A few of the woodlouse stragglers on the edge of the multitudinous crowd are flattened under the soles of your shoes and you smile, your confidence growing.</p>
<p>But then, as if some kind of telepathic signal passed between the woodlice, in exactly the same moment, there is a whisper of chitin and they simultaneously roll into tight balls - their defensive posture.</p>
<p>You try to stop your forward momentum but it is too late.</p>
<p>Your left foot propels itself through the air and comes down. Onto hundreds and hundreds of little woodlice balls. It is like stepping on a tray of marbles - you don't stand a chance. Your foot rolls on the little balls, grip on the floor hopelessly lost. It shoots forwards and your body shoots backwards - and downwards.</p>
<p>&quot;Aaaargh!&quot; you cry out, landing on the floor with a terrible crash, banging your head. Your fall has crushed to death thousands of woodlice but it is not enough, there are millions more to take their place.</p>
<p>As you slip into unconsciousness, you are vaguely aware of Snako falling next to you, like a felled tree among the woodlice. You are not sure, but you think you can hear millions of tiny cheers.</p>
<p>Then - nothing.</p>

The dungeon door</h2>
<p>As the other Hedgehog House students file off into the corridor on their way to Hedgehog House tower you and Kensley quietly tip-toe away to one side, making no more noise than little mice. After two or three turns of the passageway the hubbub of the other students has faded away to nothing.
</p><p>&quot;Where do we go now?&quot; asks Kensley, her voice shaking a little with the audacity of what you have done.</p>
<p>You look around trying to get your bearings. You realise that the school is absolutely huge. There must be hundreds of corridors, archways, passageways and staircases. How will you even find the way to the dungeons?</p>
<p>But just at that moment you notice five spiders walking along the floor, lined up one after the other. How curious, you think, what are those little fellows up to? You and Kensley start to follow them along the corridor.</p>
<p>They turn left, right, right again, then left before disappearing under a door.</p>
<p>You look up. Above the door is a sign scrawled in thick black letters: DUNGEONS.</p>
<p>&quot;I think this is the door to the Dungeons!&quot; you whisper to Kensley, afraid to speak too loud in the silence. With a trembling hand you reach out to turn the great brass doorknob and open the door. But it doesn't budge, and as you pull on the doorknob the edge of the door glows golden.</p>
<p>&quot;Look!&quot; says Kensley to you quietly, &quot;The door is locked with an enchantment. That means it will only open when you say the magic password.&quot;</p>
<p>Before you have time to speculate what the magic password might be, you hear the tramp of many feet coming towards you from around a corner. It must be a group of students on their way to their house tower! Before you have time to hide, they turn the corner and spot you.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur and Kensley isn't it? How did you two get here? Well never mind: join the line, we are all going to Hedgehog Tower now&quot; To your surprise you are addressed by one of the older Hedgehog House students.

Picked for Snakefang</h2>
<p>Snakefang House! I must be in Snakefang House.
</p><p>Coo coo Snakefang House is it? I can see that in this house you would be strong and powerful. But are you sure? asks Percy the pigeon, speaking directly into your mind now. Snakefangs are a bit, you know: evil...&quot;</p>
<p>Yes yes, you think back at him. Not a do-gooder Lionpaw, not a too-clever-by-half Ravenclaw, not a boring old Hedgehog. I want to be a Snakefang - better than all of them!</p>
<p>Coo coo as you wish young Arthur, speaks Percy into your brain.</p>
<p>Slowly the great yellow eyes shrink to normal size and you are just staring at a regular giant talking pigeon again.</p>
<p>Percy waddles over to the centre of the hole where the light from the hall shines down. He looks old and weak - you wonder how long he has been doing this. For decades? Centuries even?</p>
<p>The giant pigeon settles down on the floor, and coos once or twice. He then stands up slowly and waddles back into the darkness at the edge of the hole that is his home. On the floor he has laid a large and beautiful egg.</p>
<p>The egg is striped in colours of silver and green. The colours of Snakefang House!</p>
<p>Your heart pounding with excitement, you pick up the egg and slowly walk back up the wooden stairs to the noise and light of the Hogsnorts Great Hall.</p>
<p>As you emerge out of the pigeon hole, Slumblebore sees your egg and shouts: &quot;Arthur Otley, Snakefang House!&quot;</p><p></p>

Defense against Dark Magic</h2>
<p>You decide to go to the Defense Against Dark Magic class next. With Slumblebore warning of danger lurking in the dungeon, you want to be prepared.
</p><p>Professor Madame Blavatsky's classroom is tucked away in an inconspicuous side passage and you almost miss it as you walk past. The inside is much more impressive though, with the floor and walls covered in inky black runes and pictograms, protecting the room against baleful influences.</p>
<p>The professor herself is sitting cross-legged on a little platform at the front of the classroom with her eyes closed while the children file in.</p>
<p>She is a short lady, wearing black robes and, because she is sitting with her legs crossed, looks a little like a large black frog. Her face is pale, almost white, and you can see networks of blue veins under the skin near her temples, like a river delta draining into a swamp.</p>
<p>As the last child sits down, she opens her eyes.</p>
<p>Her eyeballs gleam white, her irises a brilliant blue.</p>
<p>&quot;Welcome children, to Defence Against Dark Magic. The most important lesson you will learn today is...&quot; Blavatsky's melodious, soothing voice pauses for a moment.</p>
<p>&quot;...control over your own mind. Because it is only when you have full control over yourself that you can hope to resist the control that dark forces may wish to exercise upon you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And what is the path to self control?&quot;</p>
<p>There is silence in the room.</p>
<p>&quot;It is self awareness. It is only by knowing yourself that you can control yourself.&quot;</p>
<p>You look over at Daniel and raise your eyebrows. You were hoping for some useful spells, this just sounds like nonsense.</p>
<p>&quot;But...&quot; continues Madame Blavatsky, &quot;I sense a doubter in the room. You!&quot; She turns her blue eyes on yours and fixes you in her gaze.</p>
<p>&quot;Have you already mastered yourself young man,&quot; she says to you. &quot;Do you really know who you are?&quot;</p>

Dinner time</h2>
<p>Joining a gaggle of other Lionpaw students you head off on the long winding route back to the Hogsnorts Great Hall to get your dinner.
</p><p>You take a seat at the Lionpaw table (after shouldering some snivelling Snakefangs out of the way) and look around amazed.</p>
<p>Tonight Slumblebore has enchanted the ceiling and the walls to look exactly as if the Great Hall had become a giant spaceship exploring the galaxy. Stars whizz by on either side and every now and again you skirt a giant whirling black hole vortex. He has even enchanted the chairs to lean to the side when the spaceship turns a corner. You stare at the stars and nebulae whooshing past with wide eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't forget to eat Arthur!&quot; Aaron reminds you, elbowing you in the side.</p>
<p>You look down to see yet another incredible feast laid out on the table. An entire roast hog with an apple in its mouth. Hundreds of chicken drumsticks covered in a delicious deep fried sauce, Kentucky style. Chips cooked to crispy perfection with overflowing bowls of tomato ketchup and mayonnaise to dip them into. Forests of broccoli, with cooked prawns hanging from the branches. Baked bananas, smothered in condensed milk and peanut butter. Strawberries, each the size of your fist with amusing faces carved into them and raisins for eyes.</p>
<p>It is all so delicious you can't stop an involuntary slobber which you quickly wipe from your chin with the table cloth.</p>
<p>You cram food into your mouth and gulp it down.</p>
<p>When you are full you have a brief food fight with Snakefang table, pelting them with giant strawberries and chicken drumsticks - they return the attack with profiteroles and bread soaked in gravy. You are particularly pleased to hit Snako Malboy in the eye with a boiled potato.</p>
<p>The fight ends when the space-scape enchantment on the walls and ceiling reveals a full scale alien spaceship attack. You scream and shout with the other students as Slumblebore simulates a spectacular laser battle.</p>
<p>Chairs are leaning crazily as the Dining Hall spaceship takes evasive action. Pretend laser bolts zap chicken drumsticks to ashes. Several Hedgehog House students vomits on the floor, overcome with motion sickness.</p>
<p>It's complete pandemonium, which ends with the total alien defeat, their broken vessels drifting through the void.</p>
<p>&quot;North paw, south paw, we score, Lionpaw!&quot; shouts Aaron at the top of his voice, overcome with excitement, boxing an imaginary foe.</p>
<p>This signals the end of the best dinner you have ever had.</p>
<p>Turning to Aaron you say.</p><p></p>

Epilogue</h2>
<p>The next few years pass happily at the school. 
</p><p>You construct a dizzyingly high tower at the centre of the school, taller than all of the other house towers put together. The insects assist you with the building work, with the ants and termites being particularly helpful.</p>
<p>You make sure that it has the best waterslides, the best lava pools, the best library in the school and invite select other students to join you, such as Daniel Colliers-Wood, Kensley Potato and the rest of the Bleezeley family. Even Eric Knid is allowed a room in the tower. Snako Malboy is not allowed in.</p>
<p>Azog teaches you all a new spell: how to shoot sticky spider web from your wand. You soon get the hang of swinging from the ceilings with the spider web silk.</p>
<p>The insects are treated better now. They are allowed to come and go as they please. Even Slumblebore has come around to the new order and can often be seen conversing with the Great Azog in his office.</p>
<p>And you: you are content. You have come a long way since that first day when you flew into the Hogsnorts school hall. You rule Hogsnorts now, from the highest tower, and the insects are back on top.</p>
<p>CONGRATULATIONS - YOU HAVE ACHIEVED THE SCHOOL TAKEOVER ENDING!</p><p></p>

A silly idea</h2>
<p>"Tonto tijeras trae tiempo!" you shout out, waving your wand above your head.
</p><p>To your surprise, a golden pair of magical scissors shoots out of the end of your wand and strikes the ceiling, and golden threads arch through the stone above your head.</p>
<p>From the golden filaments in the roof, a flutter of beautiful golden snowflakes fall. Each one has an exquisitely perfect hexagonal symmetry.</p>
<p>When they land on your arms and head, they give you a warm tingling sensation and then disappear with a tinkling sound, like a tiny bell.</p>
<p>After a few moments the golden snow fall stops and the corridor returns to its previous gloomy state.</p>
<p>&quot;Wow that was amazing Arthur,&quot; says Snako. &quot;I don't know how you did that. But it was exactly zero help with the spider web.</p><p></p>

Pass friend</h2>
<p>As you shout "Watermelon!" at the top of your voice, you point your wand at the door.
</p><p>You can feel your arm channel powerful magic. Magical golden lines leap from the tip of the wand. The golden lines strike the door and entwine the handle, the hinges, the iron bands that hold the door together.</p>
<p>An enchantingly clear note sounds and at the same time the dungeon door swings open.</p>
<p>&quot;You did it Arthur!&quot; cries Daniel, and the two of you enter the passageway, wands at the ready.</p>
<p>Stairs head downwards into the gloom, a gloom alleviated by dim flickering torches, enchanted by magic to burn forever and never go out.</p>

A speedy recovery</h2>
<p>With a groan you open your eyes.
</p><p>Looking around you you appear to be in the Hogsnorts School hospital. You see Kensley lying next to you on an identical bed, also groaning. Various medical instruments hang on the walls: stethoscopes, ear trumpets, bone-saws, syringes and thaumometers.</p>
<p>How did I get here? you wonder. Then it comes back to you and you shudder: the dungeon.</p>
<p>Something bad is definitely going on down there. With a horrible sinking feeling in your stomach you realise that it is up to you to put a stop to it. And next time you know at least one choice that you should not make again...</p>
<p>&quot;Hello Arther and Kensley. I see you have returned to the conscious realm.&quot; Madame Blavatsky, the Professor of Defence Against Dark Magic walks into the room.</p>
<p>&quot;Mmmbrlgt?&quot; you mumble.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes you had quite a shock back there I'm sure. When Slumblebore found you, you were both completely unconscious. But don't worry you will make a full recovery - the antiodarkotics I gave you will flush all the bad magic out shortly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you&quot; you manage to say.</p>
<p>&quot;But the most important thing is that you get some rest. I'm going to cast a sleeping spell on you now, timed so that you will wake up tomorrow morning at 7am. When you are sleeping soundly I will teleport you to your own bedrooms in your House Tower.&quot;</p>
<p>As she chants the magic words &quot;<em>somnolencia salchicha sabrosa</em>&quot; you try to speak but you can't stop yourself drifting away.</p>
<p>What is in the dungeon? you desperately want to ask. Your lips form the word &quot;Wha...?&quot;...</p><p></p>

The Snakefang House Tower</h2>
<p>Together with Snako Malboy, who is fast becoming your best friend, you join the line of Snakefang house children leaving the dining room on their way to the House Tower. 
</p><p>The route winds its way through the stone corridors of Hogsnorts School for what seems like hours: along high walls with battlements on one side and a steep drop on the other. Through dingy underground stone tunnels lit only by the occasional flickering torch. Up and down stone staircases with steps which sometimes seem built for a giant, and you have to clamber up one at a time, and at other times seem built for a gnome and you almost trip over them they are so small.</p>
<p>But at last you can sense from the excited chatter of the other students that you are getting closer. It also seems to be getting warmer - the cold dank of the school corridors has been replaced by a dry heat radiating from the walls.</p>
<p>Finally you reach a stone archway painted in the Snakefang House colours of silver and green.</p>
<p>&quot;We're here Snakefangs, our home sweet home,&quot; states one of the older boys. &quot;Everyone remember that only Snakefangs are allowed in the House Tower. Anyone else who tries to enter will get swallowed by the Blood Squirter, if they even get that far!&quot; The children give a low chuckle.</p>
<p>&quot;What's the Blood Squirter?&quot; you whisper to Snako.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know,&quot; he whispers back with a bloodthirsty grin, &quot;but whatever it is, it sounds super cool.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In we go then!&quot; commands the older boy and you all file through the arch. As you pass through you realise the arch is carved in the shape of an enormous open snake's mouth, its fangs dripping down like giant stalactites.</p>
<p>When you enter the tower your mouth drops open as you are confronted by a fantastic, almost otherworldly scene.</p>
<p>You are in a wide circular space paved with a shiny black stone. It is walled all around with a stone wall that rises upwards for as far as you can see, leaving a small circle of open sky at the top. It would be dark if it wasn't for the pool in the middle of this strange courtyard.</p>
<p>That's because the pool is full of glowing orange lava.</p>
<p>This must be the source of the heat you noticed in the corridor as you approached the tower. And basking on the edges of the lava pool are some huge snakes, each a different colour.</p>
<p>&quot;This is so cool,&quot; you say to Snako, and walk forwards to get a closer look. When you reach the pool of lava, one of the snakes lifts his head (as big as yours) and flickers his tongue out in your direction. You carefully reach out a hand and stroke the snake's scaly chin. He makes a satisfied hissing noise.</p>
<p>&quot;I can see he likes you,&quot; says an older girl who has walked over. &quot;Say hello to Blood Squirter.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So this is Blood Squirter - what a beautiful creature!&quot; You turn to the girl:  &quot;This place is amazing, I love the snakes, the lava lake... But it doesn't look very... comfortable. Where does everyone sit down for a rest or to go to sleep?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is just the central courtyard of the tower,&quot; shrugs the girl. &quot;We don't hang out here much, it's mainly for the snakes or when we want to toast marshmallows. No - around the edge of this big tower everyone has their own personal smaller tower which you can get to by climbing the stairs.&quot;</p>
<p>You look at where the girl is gesturing and realise that this giant tower has a long stone staircase winding its way up the inside of the wall. Every now and again the staircase has a small landing leading to a locked door.</p>
<p>&quot;You mean I have a tower <em>just for me</em>?&quot; you ask, your eyes wide, and the girl nods.</p>
<p>&quot;We have got to check this out,&quot; you say to Snako and the two of you run over to the stone staircase. As you climb you pass the locked doors that you noticed earlier and you see that each one has a name above them: Gertrude Viper-Collins, Bartholomew Beetlebottom, Lyra Poisonwood read a few.</p>
<p>After you have climbed the staircase high above the lava pool you notice two doors next to each other. Above one it says Snako Malboy and above the other Arthur Otley. You notice a much smaller sign next to the door too, which reads: 'Insert wand into key hole'.</p>
<p>With a thrill of excitement you slowly put the end of your wand into the keyhole of the door. After a moment the whole doorway is outlined in a magical golden glow and then - without a sound - the door swings inwards. At the door next to you Snako has done the same.</p>
<p>You and Snako take a deep breath, nod goodbye to each other, and enter.</p>
<p>You find yourself in the most wonderful room.</p>
<p>Whereas the courtyard below was bare and dim, this place is comfortable, light and airy. There are two or three sofas and comfy armchairs scattered around, tall windows on the room, looking down on the Hogsnorts School grounds, and a low table in front of the fireplace. You notice that the fireplace contains a little bubbling pool of lava, no doubt fed from the same source deep below the earth as the lava pool you saw earlier. A large TV and games console are nestled next to a window.</p>
<p>Kicking your shoes off and bouncing down onto a sofa, you notice a spiral iron staircase leading up to the second floor above you and realise that the girl you were talking to before was absolutely right. This is a <em>whole tower</em> just for you. The main Snakefang House Tower must be studded with hundreds of student towers, sprouting out the side of it like mushrooms.</p>
<p>Racing up the spiral iron staircase you find yourself in a large circular study room with a curved desk against one wall, some bookshelves against another, and a set of cupboards fully stocked with potent magical ingredients.</p>
<p>The next floor is a small kitchen with a magically replenishing larder to one side. Above that is the bathroom with a huge bath in the middle, propped up on four iron feet cast in the shape of snakes baring their fangs.</p>
<p>Above <em>this</em> is the bedroom, and above the bedroom under the sloping tower roof is a little astronomical observatory, complete with telescope.</p>
<p>Coming back down to the bedroom, you lie back on the enormous four-poster bed and crunch on a mint flavoured chocolate that you found on your pillow, next to a cuddly toy snake.</p>
<p>Through the window outside you can see the sun sinking slowly below the horizon.</p>
<p>You put your hands behind your head and smile. Yes, I could be happy here, you say to yourself as you slip into a deep untroubled sleep.</p><p></p>

Tweetle Beetle Bottle Battle</h2>
<p>Tweetle beetle bottle battle!" you cry as you round the corner with Kensley just behind you. 
</p><p>Aiming your wand at the beetles... nothing happens.</p>
<p>&quot;What's your plan Arthur?&quot; shouts Kensley.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know! I just thought that might work!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Didn't you just say a poem? I thought you were going to cast a spell!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well sometimes a spell does sound a <em>bit</em> like a poem because...&quot;</p>
<p>But you never get the chance to tell Kensley why a spell is sometimes a bit like a poem. Three pops are followed by three blasts of superheated acid.</p>
<p>You try to duck out of the way but you are just a fraction too slow. One splurge of acid grazes your forehead and you fall to the ground, overcome.</p>
<p>Kensley gives a shriek and hits the ground heavily beside you.</p>
<p>The last thing you see before you lose consciousness is the three giant bombardier beetles doing what appears to be a celebratory dance at the far end of the corridor.</p><p></p>

Knid&#39;s spell</h2>
<p>You sit still not wanting to encourage the professor, and none of the other students wants to disagree with him either. 
</p><p>&quot;Good. Good.&quot; says Professor Knid. &quot;Now we are all agreed, I can tell you that today we will be studying the marvellous woodlouse. Flies, deliver the woodlice!&quot;</p>
<p>At this command, a hundred or so flies detach themselves from Knid's cape, zoom over to a box on the professor's desk and pick up the woodlice, one between four flies. The flies then carry one woodlice to each student and drop it onto the desk in front of them. The flies buzz back to Professor Knid and reattach themselves to his cloak.</p>
<p>The little woodlouse on your desk appears disturbed at this unexpected flight. It takes one look at you then rolls up into a ball.</p>
<p>&quot;Now can anyone move their woodlouse using a magic spell?&quot; asks Knid. &quot;Try any magic spell that you know.&quot;</p>
<p>You raise your wand, point it at the woodlouse and mumble &quot;abracadabra&quot; rather hopefully.</p>
<p>You are delighted to see a little sparkle of gold stars shoot out of the end of your wand. The sparkles hit the woodlouse... and bounce right off! The woodlouse is unmoved.</p>
<p>Looking around the classroom you can see that the other children are having no more success than you did.</p>
<p>Kensley's ice spell has frozen her desk into a solid block of ice but not touched the woodlouse. Brian Banana (another student from Hedgehog) has tried to make his woodlouse disappear but accidentally lost his wand in the process. Snako has singed his own eyebrows when his lightning spell bounced off the woodlouse and hit him in the face.</p>
<p>&quot;The woodlouse, children, as you are discovering, is completely impervious to magic. So if you want to move the woodlouse you must first <em>understand</em> the woodlouse. And the one thing that scares the woodlouse more than anything else is drying out. As soon as they lose their moisture they die. Now - look at this.&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Knid raises his wand in an impressively expansive gesture and recites: &quot;Fiel fresa fusila fuego!&quot;</p>
<p>A large flame whooshes out of the end of his wand and starts to bake the air around the woodlouse on his desk. Terrified of being dried out, the woodlouse unrolls and scuttles away as fast as he can.</p>
<p>&quot;So we can see that <em>indirect</em> magic can be powerful against even magic resistant creatures. And we didn't have to harm any arthropods in the process. Now children it's your turn. Wands at the ready!&quot;</p>
<p>You look down at your cowering woodlouse and, aiming with your wand, recite the words of the spell:</p>
<p>&quot;Fiel fresa fusila fuego!&quot;</p>
<p>A strange tingling sensation builds in the tips of your fingers and toes and quickly builds until your entire body feels somehow <em>charged up</em>. Then with a feeling like a bit like doing a wee the magic zooms along your arm and out of your wand in a very impressive jet of flame.</p>
<p>You are delighted at the result, the first time you have cast such a wonderful spell! And a fire spell could be used for so many things - like roasting marshmallows or boiling the kettle.</p>
<p>The woodlouse feels the magical flames heat the air and desk around him, and scarpers.</p>
<p>&quot;I did it!&quot; you murmur with quiet satisfaction, and commit the words of the spell to your memory: fiel fresa fusila fuego.</p><p></p>

Professor Eric Knid Explains</h2>
<p>A voice, strong and commanding, emerges from the darkness. "One of you? The saviour, a mere stripling first year? Impossible!"
</p><p>Another voice, high pitched and chittery, answers him. &quot;Yes Eric, I know him. He is the wand holder. The other one is a friend. Do not harm them - yet!&quot;</p>
<p>As your eyes adjust to the gloom, you can make out a figure standing in the centre of the room. A wizard - someone you recognise.</p>
<p>&quot;Professor Knid!&quot; you exclaim.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes Professor Eric Knid at your service! Or perhaps I should say that you will be at my service... Arthur isn't it? And Daniel?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes my name's Arthur. Arthur Otley.&quot; A sensation of fear congeals in your throat.</p>
<p>&quot;And I'm Daniel Colliers-Wood,&quot; says your classmate. &quot;Who were you talking to just now Professor Knid?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All in good time, Daniel...&quot; with an unexpectedly swift movement Professor Knid draws his wand and shoots a spell of locking at the iron gate which clangs shut.</p>
<p>You are trapped.</p>
<p>&quot;What are you going to do?&quot; you ask.</p>
<p>Eric Knid smiled. Even in the dark you can see the mad gleam in his eye: &quot;Revolution!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Explain why Eric.&quot; That chittering voice again, appearing out of nowhere.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes - why. Why?&quot; Professor Knid takes a deep breath. &quot;Ever since I was a young boy I have felt an affinity with insects, spiders, crabs. With the Arthropods. A dog will bite you, not so an earwig! A lion may eat you, not so a woodlouse! A human may betray you, a spider will not.</p>
<p>&quot;My faithful friends growing up were slugs, ants, flies and beetles. But my friends were mercilessly crushed, poisoned, and swatted by humans.</p>
<p>&quot;The final straw? Slumblebore sat on a spider - and laughed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I couldn't bear it. I sought out the Great Spider King Azog himself. What joy when I found him in the forbidden bushes and entered his service. Together we have been gathering supporters here in this dungeon, insects and spiders in their millions. For revenge. For a revolution. To take over the school!</p>
<p>&quot;No longer will it just be Lionpaw House, Ravenwing House, Snakefang House, and Hedgehog House! We will have a new house mightier than all of them. The Order of the Arthropods! And I will be headmaster.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But why us?&quot; fear chills you. &quot;What has this got to with us?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is Arthur who we need, he is the only one who can stop us now,&quot; says the mysterious high pitched voice. &quot;But with you on our side we will be invincible!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who is that speaking?&quot; Daniel cries.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the Great Spider King Azog himself. And you are honoured to stand in his presence.&quot; Professor Knid explains.</p>
<p>&quot;Where?&quot; You can't see anyone other than the Professor.</p>
<p>&quot;Here!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where, I can't see!&quot;</p>

Knid&#39;s insects</h2>
<p>You raise your hand and ask "Aren't ravens better than insects? They're much smarter for a start."
</p><p>&quot;Ravens! Pshaw. I would have thought that a Ravenwing student like you would be a bit smarter yourself! No boy, ravens are <em>not</em> better than insects.</p>
<p>&quot;Firstly: ravens may know how to fly but can't fly, but insects figured it out long before birds did. Insects have been flying for over 350 million years! But insects have been flying for twice as long as birds - birds only evolved 150 million years ago. Pathetic.</p>
<p>&quot;Secondly: a raven's cleverness is nothing compared even to an ant, who - working together - can build homes hundreds of times taller than they are. Skyscrapers! With air-conditioning, nurseries, storage chambers. And what is a raven's home? Just a pile of twigs. Rubbish.</p>
<p>&quot;Thirdly: how many ravens are there in the world? Not many I can tell you. Or how many birds even? 100 billion - at least that's what wikimagia says!</p>
<p>&quot;But how many insects are there in the world? 10 quintillion! That's 10 followed by 18 zeros. For every one pitiful bird on the earth there are 100 million amazing insects.</p>
<p>&quot;No, it is clear to me, as it should now be clear to you, that ravens are pitiful, almost inconsequential creatures compared to insects and arthropods.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But sir,&quot; interrupts Daniel, &quot;insects <em>are</em> a bit well, disgusting...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh the cheek of it! Who is to say that you are not disgusting to an insect young man? There will come a day - and maybe sooner than you think - when everyone will appreciate the magnificence of an insect, when people don't shudder when I brush past them with my cloak. Yes you will appreciate those 'disgusting' insects soon enough my boy.&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Jape paused and pinched the bridge of his nose with two fingers. &quot;Class dismissed. Your homework is to write an essay with the title 'What I love most about insects and arthropods'. Two thousand words minimum.&quot;</p><p></p>

<p>The clock strikes one... two... three.
</p><p>The golden glow shining all around you gets stronger and stronger and soon you have to shut your eyes to the blinding golden light.</p>

<p>Opening your eyes you find you are at the bottom of a great stone well, with a circle of light far above. You realise that you have magically transported back to Percy the Picking Pigeon's hole in the Hogsnort's Great Hall, just as Slumblebore said you would. Somehow you know that you have also travelled back in time to before, when you had just arrived at the school. You are that Arthur once again in Percy's hole, but this time you can make a new choice.</p>

Balls up</h2>
<p>"Let's just walk over the woodlice," you say to Aaron. "I mean, we _are_ about a million times heavier than them. We _should_ just be able to squash them as we go."
</p><p>&quot;I don't know Arthur,&quot; replies Aaron, a look of fear in his eyes. &quot;Do you really think it will work?&quot;</p>
<p>In answer you take a determined stride forwards, towards the waiting woodlice hordes. They look back at you (do they have eyes?) their little antenna waving in the air. Aaron sets off behind you with a little whimper.</p>
<p>The first couple of steps pass without mishap. A few of the woodlouse stragglers on the edge of the multitudinous crowd are flattened under the soles of your shoes and you smile, your confidence growing.</p>
<p>But then, as if some kind of telepathic signal passed between the woodlice, in exactly the same moment, there is a whisper of chitin and they simultaneously roll into tight balls - their defensive posture.</p>
<p>You try to stop your forward momentum but it is too late.</p>
<p>Your left foot propels itself through the air and comes down. Onto hundreds and hundreds of little woodlice balls. It is like stepping on a tray of ball bearings - you don't stand a chance. Your foot rolls on the little balls, grip on the floor hopelessly lost. It shoots forwards and your body shoots backwards - and downwards.</p>
<p>&quot;Aaaargh!&quot; you cry out, landing on the floor with a terrible crash, banging your head. Your fall has crushed to death thousands of woodlice but it is not enough, there are millions more to take their place.</p>
<p>As you slip into unconsciousness, you are vaguely aware of Aaron falling next to you, like a felled tree among the woodlice. You are not sure, but you think you can hear millions of tiny cheers.</p>
<p>Then - nothing.</p>

Magical mayhem</h2>
<p>You raise your wand, point it at the woodlice menacingly and shout loudly:
</p><p>&quot;Dispara dinosaurio demente!&quot;</p>
<p>From out of the end of your wand comes a faint but growing roaring sound, like an angry lion. The noise grows louder and louder until it is so loud it hurts your ears.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur, what did you do?&quot; asks Daniel in alarm.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't...&quot; you begin, but before you can finish your sentence, a huge golden dinosaur head somehow <em>forces</em> it's way out of the tip of your wand, and roars again deafeningly.</p>
<p>&quot;ROAR!!!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did I ever tell you that I don't like giant angry tyrannosaurus rexes!&quot; yells out Daniel, eyes with fear.</p>
<p>But there's nothing you can do, the spell has been cast. The enormous magical t-rex squeezes its way out of your wand and charges its way towards the woodlice, waggling its ridiculous little front arms in a demented fashion.</p>
<p>It launches itself at the nearest woodlouse which has no time to react.</p>
<p>But instead of crushing the woodlouse in its banana sized teeth, the t-rex - impossibly - just bounces off.</p>
<p>It roars and tries again, with the same result.</p>
<p>Then it hits you - woodlice are completely immune to magic.</p>
<p>The dinosaur appears to understand this too. It looks around for a better target. And it's crazy little red eyes fix on you and Daniel.</p>
<p>With a sense of horror you realise that the t-rex is now hunting <em>you</em>!</p>
<p>The rabid dinosaur leaps at you and Daniel but instead of eating you it flings you both into the stone wall on each side and you bump your head painfully. The t-rex stomps up the corridor before disappearing a puff of gold stars as the magic wears off.</p>
<p>As you slide down the wall and into unconsciousness, you can see the millions of woodlice waving their little antennae. As you close your eyes you think: are they laughing?</p><p></p>

Lessons finished for the day</h2>
<p>Making sure that you have got all of your quills, ink bottles, spell books and sweets, you put your bag on your shoulder and leave the Great Hall to go back to the House Tower with Aaron
</p><p>Strangely enough you find you can remember the way back there easily - the path had seemed so long and winding on your first day. Perhaps it was something to do with eating the Lionpaw Egg from Percy the Picking Pigeon that has given you a homing instinct for the Tower.</p>
<p>When you arrive you head straight to the sauna and get a wonderful massage from one of the giant snails, who slithers around on your back while you lie down.</p>
<p>Refreshed you pop your robes back on, give the snail a pat on the back, and turn to Aaron.</p><p></p>

Cut through the web</h2>
<p>"Vamos varita vencer vistosamente!" you exclaim as dramatically as you can manage.
</p><p>A flickering golden light slowly extends from the top of your wand until it is about a metre long. You swing the &quot;light sword&quot; around and it makes a satisfying swishing zooming sound. Your whole body thrills with the sensation of power.</p>
<p>&quot;Aaah yes!&quot; you hiss, and swipe the nearest strand of spider silk. Despite it being as thick as a steel cable and twice as tough, the light sword slices through it with no effort at all and the spider web flops to the floor.</p>
<p>You steadily walk forwards, cutting through the spider web with your magical golden light sword, feeling the magic from the wand course through your body. The sensation of this powerful magic is delicious.</p>
<p>Soon the spider web has gone. You and Snako race down the passageway and skid around a corner...</p><p></p>

Bunking off</h2>
<p>"You're right Aaron, let's just chillax round here for today. We can also catch up on lessons tomorrow."
</p><p>Aaron grins. &quot;Chillax it is. Get your swimming trunks Arthur, and let's check out the steam room!&quot;</p>
<p>You race back to your bedroom, change into your swimming trunks and grab a fluffy white Lionpaw monogrammed towel.</p>
<p>After a few minutes relaxing in the steam room, you decide to see what is in the room marked &quot;Infinity Pools&quot;, and are delighted to find a huge sloped area full of different temperature pools, each one flowing into another. In each pool is a collection of enchanted bath toys: rubber ducks that swim around, plastic fish that jump from pool to pool and playful sponges that throw themselves.</p>
<p>When you are bored with this you head to the Virtual reality gaming room. You and Aaron lose yourself for a couple of hours playing virtual reality tennis and ten-pin bowling.</p>
<p>After a spell riding the giant floor cleaning snails around the common room in slow motion races, you spend the rest of the day in the Lionpaw House Tower waterpark, sliding down the slides, surfing on the wave machine, or sailing miniature pirate ships and firing the water cannons at each other.</p>
<p>Finally you and Aaron are both exhausted and you go to the main common room to relax on a sofa. After a while the other Lionpaw students arrive from their lessons.</p>

<p>"I'm not sure I really fit in with my house," you say.
</p><p>&quot;Not the right house, eh?&quot; repeats Slumblebore. &quot;Well it wouldn't be the first time it has happened. Percy can pigeon hole people a bit too quickly at times - he is getting old now and sometimes I think his heart isn't really in it any more. Despite the fact that we feed him well and he gets to sing a song every year.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; you say, &quot;I think it just all happened too quickly when I arrived at the school and I didn't really know what it is was going to be <em>like</em> in Lionpaw House.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hmmm,&quot; ponders Slumblebore. &quot;With a bit more time you may come to like it, don't you think? You know that after Percy the Picking Pigeon has chosen your house you can't change it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No I'm never going to like it sir,&quot; you reply blinking back tears. &quot;I'll just be miserable my entire life.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well... in that case there is something I can do. I said that you can't change your house <em>after</em> you have chosen it but luckily I am something of an expert in temporal magic - the magic of time. I can send you back in time to <em>before</em> you have chosen your house and you can choose all over again. How about that Arthur?&quot;</p>
<p>You nod in reply. &quot;Yes thank you sir.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well then, just step into this clock over here...&quot; Slumblebore points to a large grandfather clock standing against the wall. The clock face is a little higher than your head and the main body of the clock has a small door, with a space behind that you can squeeze into.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm going to set the time to after dinner on the first night...&quot;</p>
<p>You can see Slumblebore's feet and flowing robes as he fiddles with the clock face above you.</p>
<p>&quot;When the clock strikes three you will travel back in time, and if I have got my calculations right, you will also travel sideways in space to arrive in the great hall at just the right time. Remember to come and see me again in my office later on. Or do I mean earlier on? The magic is starting soon now, good luck!&quot;</p>

The wake up call</h2>
<p>You wake up feeling refreshed and happy but are momentarily unsure of where you are... Then it comes back to you and you laugh out loud with delight.
</p><p>You are a student at the Hogsnorts School of Magic, you've been picked for the best house (Snakefang) and you have been given your very own tower to live in, complete with living room, study, kitchen, magically replenishing larder, astronomical observatory, bedroom and ensuite bathroom.</p>
<p>What's more you have a new best friend: Snako Malboy.</p>
<p>Which reminds you, Snako was allocated the tower next to you, and you wonder if he is up yet.</p>
<p>You quickly throw on your clothes and dash down the spiral iron staircases until you are at the bottom of your tower and head out of the door.</p>
<p>You almost bump into Snako who was dashing out of his tower to come and see you.</p>
<p>&quot;Snako&quot; you say, &quot;Isn't it amazing to have our own tower!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's super cool,&quot; said Snako, &quot;and I got a mint chocolate on my pillow! But listen, Arthur, I'm thinking we should spend today exploring the Snakefang House tower. We can go to lessons tomorrow, no-one will miss us.&quot;</p><p></p>

The Order of the Athropods</h2>
<p>You realise that _this_ is your destiny, to command the insect horde, to lead them.
</p><p>You hold out your hand to Azog, who extends a spindly leg and climbs up your arm and onto your shoulder.</p>
<p>&quot;Well done Arthur&quot; says Azog, &quot;You have chosen... wisely.&quot;</p>
<p>Millions upon millions of insects are looking at you with their two, four or eight compound eyes, eyes on the sides of their heads, eyes on stalks, all waiting. Waiting for your command.</p>
<p>&quot;Insects!&quot; you exclaim. &quot;Arthropods! Follow me!&quot;</p>
<p>Looking back, the rest of that night seems more like a fantastic dream than reality.</p>
<p>You lead the insect army up through the passageways out of the dungeon and into the school. But instead of leading them to the centre of the school as Azog expected, you show them the way to Hedgehog House tower.</p>
<p>From there the whole streaming mass of ants, spiders, earwigs, woodlice and beetles emerges onto the cool night air of the hillside where the Hoggers live in their holes.</p>
<p>&quot;But Arthur,&quot; protests Azog. &quot;I thought we were taking over the school!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; you replied simply. &quot;Fighting only creates more fighting. Where will it end? What we need is peace.&quot;</p>
<p>You carry on walking, and hear the whispers of the insects as they follow you: &quot;peeece&quot; they say, &quot;peeeeeece&quot;.</p>
<p>Finally reaching the end of the lane of Hogger Holes you instruct them to dig.</p>
<p>Working together, before the sun has come up, the insects excavate a magnificent, glorious Hogger Hole of their own. While the door looks normal, and the initial tunnel is cosy enough to deceive the casual visitor - with umbrella stands and varnished wooden chairs with green velvet seats - soon the tunnel branches out into smaller and smaller passages, until they match the size of the insects that will live in them.</p>
<p>When the labour is complete, you turn to the tired, muddy, but happy insect multitude, and smile.</p>
<p>&quot;Insects,&quot; you say, &quot;welcome home.&quot;</p><p></p>

The heart of the dungeon</h2>
<p>You remember that woodlice are one of the few creatures that are completely immune to magic of any kind, and decide to cast a heat spell to clear a path indirectly. 
</p><p>You raise your wand. &quot;Fiel fresa fusila fuego!&quot;</p>
<p>A magical flame whooshes out of your wand, sending golden sparks shooting.</p>
<p>The flame doesn't harm the woodlice, but it heats the air, and dries it. The woodlice have no option but to retreat: without moisture they can't absorb oxygen, they would suffocate.</p>
<p>This leaves a path.</p>
<p>&quot;Wait!&quot; says Snako. &quot;I... I can't go any further.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What's wrong?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's the woodlice. I have had a terrible fear of them ever since I accidentally ate one thinking it was a small nut. The feeling of its little legs wriggling in my stomach is something that has haunted me ever since. I can't... I just can't go on.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Listen Snako, it's ok. I'll keep going but if you're too afraid you are no good to me down here anyway. You should turn back and tell Slumblebore what we have found down here. Tell him that I wasn't afraid and decided to carry on&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, yes... I will Arthur. Slumblebore needs to know,&quot; says Snako in relief. &quot;I'll go and tell him.&quot;</p>
<p>Snako turns and hot-foots it back the way you came.</p>
<p>As his hurried footsteps fade into the distant darkness, you breathe deeply and plunge forwards past the woodlouse army who are retreating into the still moist cracks in the stone.</p>
<p>After walking further down the dank, chilly passage you come to a door made of iron bars.</p>
<p>Just beyond you can hear a faint murmur of voices.</p>
<p>This is it: the heart of the dungeon. Whoever or whatever has been setting these traps for you and Snako must be here, at the bottom of it all.</p><p></p>

<p>&quot;But magic is just gibberish to me, my thesis was that if...&quot;</p>
<p>But you never get the chance to tell Daniel what your thesis was. Three pops are followed by three blasts of superheated acid.</p>
<p>You try to duck out of the way but you are just a fraction too slow. One splurge of acid grazes your forehead and you fall to the ground, overcome.</p>
<p>Daniel hits the ground heavily beside you.</p>

The Lionpaw House Tower</h2>
<p>You and Aaron join the train of students from Lionpaw house. All the first years are chattering to each other, excited to visit their house tower for the first time.
</p><p>Your route twists and turns, down passageways and corridors, through archways and cloisters. At times you pass by stained glass windows that stretch far up to the high ceiling and coloured light streams through the passageway. At other times the stone lined walls are dark and low with just the occasional torch flickering from the wall to illuminate your passage.</p>
<p>At last the line of Lionpaw students arrives at an archway framed in brilliant blue and gleaming gold.</p>
<p>&quot;Well Lionpaws!&quot; shouts out an older girl at the front of the line. &quot;We have arrived at Lionpaw House tower! First years, this will be your home for the next 6 years - remember that only Lionpaws can pass this archway, so if you have any friends in other houses...&quot; there are boos and laughter from the children at this remark &quot;...you will have to <em>fraternize</em> elsewhere! Into the Lion's den everyone!&quot;</p>
<p>With that she turns and leads you all inside.</p>
<p>You realise that the stone archway is carved in the shape of a lion's open mouth, with sharp stone fangs hanging down like stalagmites.</p>
<p>When you pass through the archway you can't help but stop and stare, your mouth hanging open almost as wide as the lion's jaws you have just passed through.</p>
<p>You are confronted by a large bright circular space. Dangling from the ceiling far above are golden globes enchanted with a magico-flourescent light that illuminates a patterned marble floor. As you enter the room a handful of spell-bound goat-sized magical snails swivel their eyes stalks in your direction - doomed to forever slither the marble flagstones, the snails buff them to a gleaming brightness as they go. Scattered around are luxurious sofas, comfy armchairs and expensive rugs.</p>
<p>Doorways leading to staircases are spaced at regular intervals around this enormous room. Above each doorway is a little sign and you read some of them:</p>
<p>&quot;Bedrooms. Snack store. Swimming Pool. Virtual reality gaming room. Sauna. Infinity Pools. Steam Room....&quot; you look at Aaron. &quot;Did you know about this? This place is amazing!&quot;</p>
<p>Alex Bleazely, Aaron's older brother hears you: &quot;Listen Arthur, if Hogsnorts is going to attract the best talent and compete with the top international universities like Yale, Cambridge, Dorkstrang and Hull we need the best facilities. Right, I'm going to change into my swimming trunks - last one in the Jacuzzi is an eggy drifter!&quot;</p>
<p>Alex and Robert Bleezely dash off, followed by two or three other Lionpaw students, whooping and hollering.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's go and find our bedrooms Arthur,&quot; says Aaron.</p>
<p>You go up the staircase marked &quot;Bedrooms&quot; and when you reach the next floor you see two more doorways, one with a sign saying &quot;Arthur&quot; above it and another with an &quot;Aaron&quot; sign. By some magical warping of space the inside of the Lionpaw House tower must be much bigger than the outside.</p>
<p>You push open the door to your bedroom.</p>
<p>A softly carpeted corridor opens onto a cozy little living room. Another door leads to a spacious bathroom containing a large bathtub with four carved iron lion feet at each corner. Finally your bedroom itself, in the centre of which is a giant four-poster bed, festooned with blue and gold drapes. On the pillow is a cuddly little toy lion and a small mint chocolate. A window in your bedrooms looks out over the Hogsnorts school grounds far below where the sun is sinking below the horizon.</p>
<p>You take off your shoes and jump backwards onto the bed. I could be happy here you think to yourself as you crunch up the mint chocolate - already it feels like home. With a smile on your face you fall fast asleep.</p><p></p>

The dark web</h2>
<p>You and Daniel start pushing at the spider web with your hands.
</p><p>It is amazingly strong and also <em>sticky</em>. With every push you get more and more enmeshed in the web and it becomes harder and harder to unstick yourself.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur&quot;, cries Daniel, &quot;I'm stuck!&quot;</p>
<p>You turn to the side and see that somehow Daniel has got himself totally tangled up in the web - he is hanging upside down with spider webs curled round his ankles and his hair brushing the floor.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't worry Daniel, let's see if we can figure out a way to free ourselves!&quot; you reply but as you try to move over towards Daniel you feel thick ropes of spider web curl around your legs and lift you up into the air. In an instant you are as helpless as he is.</p>
<p>You feel your panic rising as you struggle. Who is going to help you now? No-one even knows that you are here except perhaps Slumblebore.</p>
<p>&quot;Watch out Arthur, look! Spiders! Millions of spiders!&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel is right. Crawling out of the cracks of the walls, floor and ceiling is a host of spiders. They scurry along the webs heading for you and Daniel. In a sudden insight you realise that these spiders have made the webs themselves, working as a one enormous team to add strand after strand of spider silk until they had created these rope-thick cobwebs. So many spiders working as one! You are amazed to see such well coordinated behaviour, so rare in most spider species. Has a new species evolved in the dungeon? you wonder.</p>
<p>Then all thoughts flee from your mind as the wave of spiders reach you. They stop inches away.</p>
<p>One lone spider - no bigger than the rest - scuttles out of the pack, delicately steps onto your robes then up to your neck. You see a flash of tiny fangs then you fade into unconsciousness.</p><p></p>

<p>You choose Offensive Magic with Professor Comicus Jape.
</p><p>You find the classroom after only a few wrong turns, and take a seat next to Snako. You see a boy called Aaron Bleezely from Lionpaw class looking at you with a frown in his face. Stupid Lionpaws, you think to yourself, and sneer at him supersiliously.</p>
<p>&quot;Now then children!&quot; Professor Jape calls out at the front of the class. &quot;Now then, now then! It's so lovely to meet you all.&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Jape is wearing a black cape with a red velvet lining and has a very pale almost white face. He smiles at the class warmly and gives a little wink.</p>
<p>&quot;Today we are going to learn some offensive magic. Now as you probably know offensive magic can be extremely dangerous. But that's not to say we can't have a bit of a laugh and a giggle as we go along eh? Eh children? Eh?&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Jape makes a loud high pitched giggling noise. Some of the other children laugh back nervously.</p>
<p>&quot;In fact I always like to break the ice with my new children with a joke. Hands up if you want to hear one of my jokes children.&quot;</p><p></p>

Magical mayhem</h2>
<p>You raise your wand, point it at the woodlice menacingly and shout loudly:
</p><p>&quot;Dispara dinosaurio demente!&quot;</p>
<p>From out of the end of your wand comes a faint but growing roaring sound, like an angry lion. The noise grows louder and louder until it is so loud it hurts your ears.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur, what did you do?&quot; asks Snako in alarm.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't...&quot; you begin, but before you can finish your sentence, a huge golden dinosaur head somehow <em>forces</em> it's way out of the tip of your wand, and roars again deafeningly.</p>
<p>&quot;ROAR!!!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did I ever tell you that I'm terrified of giant angry tyrannosaurus rexes!&quot; yells out Snako, too petrified to move.</p>
<p>But there's nothing you can do, the spell has been cast. The enormous magical t-rex squeezes its way out of your wand and charges its way towards the woodlice, waggling its ridiculous little front arms in a demented fashion.</p>
<p>It launches itself at the nearest woodlouse which has no time to react.</p>
<p>But instead of crushing the woodlouse in its banana sized teeth, the t-rex - impossibly - just bounces off.</p>
<p>It roars and tries again, with the same result.</p>
<p>Then it hits you - woodlice are completely immune to magic.</p>
<p>The dinosaur appears to understand this too. It looks around for a better target. And it's crazy little red eyes fix on you and Snako.</p>
<p>With a sense of horror you realise that the t-rex is now hunting <em>you</em>!</p>
<p>The rabid dinosaur leaps at you and Snako but instead of eating you it flings you both into the stone wall on each side and you bump your head painfully. The t-rex stomps up the corridor before disappearing a puff of gold stars as the magic wears off.</p>
<p>As you slide down the wall and into unconsciousness, you can see the millions of woodlice waving their little antennae. As you close your eyes you think: are they laughing?</p><p></p>

The dungeon door</h2>
<p>As the other Ravenwing students file off into the corridor on their way to Ravenwing House tower you and Daniel quietly tip-toe away to the side. After two or three turns of the passageway the noise of the other students has faded to nothing.
</p><p>&quot;Now where?&quot; asks Daniel, a tremor of fear and excitement in his voice.</p>
<p>You look around trying to get your bearings. You realise that the school is absolutely huge. There must be hundreds of corridors, archways, passageways and staircases. How will you even find the way to the dungeons?</p>
<p>Just then you notice five spiders walking along the floor, lined up one after the other. What are those curious little creatures up to? you think, and start to follow them along the corridor.</p>
<p>They turn left, right, right again, then left before disappearing under a crack in the doorway.</p>
<p>You look up. Above the door is a sign scrawled in thick black letters: DUNGEONS.</p>
<p>&quot;This is it!&quot; you whisper to Daniel, afraid to speak too loud in the silence. You reach out to turn the great brass doorknob and open the door. But it doesn't budge, and as you pull on the doorknob the edge of the door glows golden.</p>
<p>&quot;Look!&quot; says Daniel to you quietly, &quot;The door is enchanted with an enchantment of locking. We'll never open it if we don't know the magic password. We need to figure out a way to get the password if we are going to get inside.&quot;</p>
<p>At that moment you hear lots of footsteps coming your way from around a corner. It must be a group of students on their way to their house tower! Before you have time to hide, they turn the corner and spot you.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur and Daniel isn't it? What are you two doing there, exploring the castle already? Come on back into line!&quot; To your surprise you are addressed by one of the older Ravenwing students. You must have somehow taken a hidden shortcut when following the spiders.</p><p></p>

Another chance</h2>
<p>The clock strikes one... two... three.
</p><p>The golden glow shining all around you gets stronger and stronger and soon you have to shut your eyes to the blinding golden light.</p>
<p>After a momentary sensation of vertigo, as if you have all of a sudden <em>fallen</em>, you sense that the golden light is fading away.</p>
<p>Opening your eyes you find you are at the bottom of a great stone well, with a circle of light far above. You realise that you have magically transported back to Percy the Picking Pigeon's hole in the Hogsnort's Great Hall, just as Slumblebore said you would. Somehow you know that you have also travelled back in time to before, when you had just arrived at the school. You are that Arthur once again in Percy's hole, but this time you can make a new choice.</p>
<p>&quot;Well Arthur,&quot; says a voice directly to your brain. &quot;What will you choose, coo coo.&quot; It is Percy the giant pigeon and you see again his giant yellow eyes staring at you.</p>

Cut through the web</h2>
<p>"Vamos varita vencer vistosamente!" you exclaim as dramatically as you can manage.
</p><p>A flickering golden light slowly extends from the top of your wand until it is about a metre long. You swing the &quot;light sword&quot; around and it makes a satisfying swishing zooming sound. You feel slightly terrified at the thought of all the damage you could do with this sabre made of light.</p>
<p>You take a tentative swipe at the nearest strand of spider silk. Despite it being as thick as a steel cable and twice as tough, the light sword slices through it with no effort at all and the spider web flops to the floor.</p>
<p>You steadily walk forwards, cutting through the spider web with your magical golden light sword, feeling the magic from the wand course through your body. You feel you are getting the hang of this magic thing!</p>
<p>Soon the spider web has gone. You and Kensley race down the passageway and skid around a corner...</p><p></p>

<p>Looking around you, you can see that you are at the junction of a number of stone corridors.
</p><p>One passageway has a sign above it saying &quot;Slumblebore's office this way&quot;.</p>
<p>Another one appears to lead downwards with a gentle slope.</p>
<p>A spiral staircase climbs up from another doorway. A little sign with an arrow reads: &quot;Your heart's desire's desire.&quot;</p>
<p>The new moon shines in from a tall narrow window.</p>
<p>You remember that the corridor to your left goes back to your house tower.</p>

The dungeon door</h2>
<p>You enter the passageway sloping downwards and after many twists and turns in the passageway you are hopelessly lost.
</p><p>You notice a charming little spider running around a corner ahead of you. Curiously it then comes back round the corner, looks at you and waits, then lifts up a spindly leg and points.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur&quot; says Kensley, &quot;I think that charming little little spider wants us to follow him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not sure if we should really be doing this...&quot; you say. &quot;But Let's see where it goes.&quot;</p>
<p>You follow the spider as it turns this way then that and are delighted to finally arrive at what must surely be the entrance to the dungeon.</p>
<p>A huge wooden door, banded with iron and patterned with silver swirls, stands within a stone archway. Either side of the door two antique sets of armour are positioned upright as if on guard.</p>
<p>The spider you were following scurries through the keyhole of the door and disappears.</p>
<p>Above the door there is a sign written in some archaic font, which reads: &quot;DUNGEON&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur!&quot; Kensley exclaims, &quot;I think this may be the door to the dungeon!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You may be onto something Kensley&quot;, you reply. &quot;But don't get carried away <em>just</em> yet.&quot;</p>
<p>You try the doorknob... but it doesn't budge.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a magical enchantment of locking on the door!&quot; says Kensley. &quot;We will need to cast a counter spell if we are to get through.&quot;</p>

Beetle battle</h2>
<p>You find yourself face to face with a trio of bombardier beetles, who seem to be guarding the way. 
</p><p>&quot;Look how large these three fine specimens are!&quot; says Daniel. &quot;I wonder how they will react to a human presence?&quot;</p>
<p>You find out immediately: as one of them makes an angry chittering sound. Even though you don't understand the beetle exactly, you are pretty sure he or she or it doesn't like you.</p>
<p>The three beetles turn around in the corridor to face away from you.</p>
<p>&quot;How curious, they seem to be retreating&quot; remarks Daniel with a puzzled look.</p>
<p>Suddenly there is a loud popping sound and an aqueous solution of hydroquinones and hydrogen peroxides shoots out of the beetles' posterior regions.</p>
<p>&quot;Duck!&quot; you cry, and you and Daniel throw yourself to one side. The liquid misses you by inches. The stone flagstone bubbles and fizzes where the liquid struck it.</p>
<p>You both pick yourself up off the floor and scramble back round the corner for safety.</p>
<p>&quot;That was too close,&quot; you say. &quot;We need to find a way to immobilise those beetles, or distract them somehow.&quot;</p>
<p>You think hard, there must be a spell that you can use that would incapacitate those three remarkable creatures, preferably without harming them so they can be studied later.</p>
<p>After a moment, with a determined spring in your step, you decide. You leap out from your hiding place, your wand at the ready.</p><p></p>

A speedy recovery</h2>
<p>With a groan you open your eyes.
</p><p>Looking around you you appear to be in the Hogsnorts School hospital. You see Snako lying next to you on an identical bed, also groaning. Various medical instruments hang on the walls: stethoscopes, ear trumpets, bone-saws, syringes and thaumometers.</p>
<p>How did I get here? you wonder. Then it comes back to you and you shudder: the dungeon.</p>
<p>Something bad is definitely going on down there. Now even more than before you realise that you <em>have</em> to find out what it is, and stop it. Or somehow claim its power for yourself. It is up to you - and for next time you know at least one choice that you should not make again...</p>
<p>&quot;Hello Arther and Snako. I see you have returned to the conscious realm.&quot; Madame Blavatsky, the Professor of Defence Against Dark Magic walks into the room.</p>
<p>&quot;Wssrrflbittit?&quot; you mumble.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes you had quite a shock back there I'm sure. When Slumblebore found you, you were both completely unconscious. But don't worry you will make a full recovery - the antiodarkotics I gave you will flush all the bad magic out shortly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you&quot; you manage to say.</p>
<p>&quot;But the most important thing is that you get some rest. I'm going to cast a sleeping spell on you now, timed so that you will wake up tomorrow morning at 7am. When you are sleeping soundly I will teleport you to your own bedrooms in your House Tower.&quot;</p>
<p>As she chants the magic words &quot;<em>somnolencia salchicha sabrosa</em>&quot; you try to speak but you can't stop yourself drifting away.</p>
<p>What is in the dungeon? you desperately want to ask. Your lips form the word &quot;Wha...?&quot;...</p><p></p>

The heart of the dungeon</h2>
<p>With an uncharacteristic flash of inspiration, you remember that woodlice are one of the few creatures that are completely immune to magic of any kind... but! They detest dryness and heat. Ergo you can cast a heat spell to clear a path indirectly. Brilliant!
</p><p>You raise your wand. &quot;Fiel fresa fusila fuego!&quot;</p>
<p>A magical flame whooshes out of your wand, sending golden sparks shooting.</p>
<p>The flame doesn't harm the woodlice, but it heats the air, and dries it. The woodlice have no option but to retreat: without moisture they can't absorb oxygen, they would suffocate.</p>
<p>This leaves open a path.</p>
<p>&quot;Wait!&quot; says Kensley. &quot;I... I can't go on.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What's wrong? Why not?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's the woodlice. I have had a terrible fear of them ever since one accidentally rolled into my cake mixture when I was a child. It got baked into a scone and I ate it by mistake. I can still feel the horrible crunch when I bit through its carapace, and the hideous tickle when I swallowed its roasted legs. I can't... I just can't get any closer to them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Listen Kensley, don't worry,&quot; you take a deep breath. &quot;I'll keep going by myself, on my own. You get Slumblebore and tell him what is going on down here. And if should... if I should... die down here, tell him that I would like to be buried outside my lovely little Hogger Hole next to the potatoes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, yes... I will Arthur. I'll get Slumblebore and we will bury you in the potato patch together,&quot; says Kensley with a little sniffle.</p>
<p>Kensley turns and walks quickly back up the passageway. As she walks you notice that she has put her hand in her pocket and is fiddling with something which then drops out of her pocket and hits the stone flagstones with a faint chink. Kensley doesn't notice and walks on, but the <em>thing</em> bounces and then rolls down the corridor towards you, stopping at your feet.</p>
<p>You bend down and pick it up. It is a ring of pure gold.</p>
<p>How curious, you think.</p>
<p>Even more curious, you can just make out some tiny writing engraved on the surface of the ring, which says:</p>
<div class="text-poem">
<p><em>One Ring to trick them all,<br>
One Ring to cloud you,<br>
One Ring to fool them all,<br>
In ghostly darkness shroud you.</em></p>
</div>
<p>But there is no time to worry about mysterious rings: you breathe deeply and plunge forwards past the woodlouse army who are delving into the still moist cracks in the stone.</p>
<p>After walking further down the dank, chilly passage you come to a door made of iron bars.</p>
<p>Just beyond you can hear a faint murmur of voices.</p>
<p>This is it: the heart of the dungeon. Whoever or whatever has been setting these traps for you and Kensley must be here, at the bottom of it all.</p><p></p>

What must I do?</h2>
<p>"I will do it, though I do not know how," you say. 
</p><p>&quot;My dear Arthur! Students really are amazing creatures. You can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a day and yet after a hundred years they can still surprise you.&quot; Slumblebore regards you with twinkling eyes and chuckles.</p>
<p>&quot;As to the how: first you must deactivate the locking spell on the dungeon door with the magic password: watermelon.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Watermelon?&quot; you repeat.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes: watermelon. I chose this password because it is my favourite fruit. The juicy red flesh, so tasty!... the visual contrast with the green outer skin.... the crunchy black pips - delicious!&quot;</p>
<p>Slumblebore stares into the distance for a few moments then snaps out of his reverie.</p>
<p>&quot;Where was I? Yes: watermelon. Then you must descend the staircase that leads down into the very depths of the school. In the past students would be imprisoned in the dungeons for misbehaviour. Now they are mainly used to store broken chairs and Christmas decorations. But we go down there so infrequently there is no telling what evil is brewing in some dark corner.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I advise you to keep your wand at the ready and your wits sharp Arthur. And remember all the lessons, all the spells, the teachers have taught you. You will be put to the test and I do not know how it will turn out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sir,&quot; you ask. &quot;What do you <em>think</em> is down there?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Long have I studied this question, seeking knowledge in ancient scrolls and consulting with the wisest of the wise. Not a sausage. All I can say is that in the dead of night when I listen hard at the dungeon door I can sometimes hear a faint murmuring noise... like the ghosts of a thousand lost souls groaning at their fate. Either that or it's the hot water system.&quot;</p><p></p>

<p>You wake up and for a moment you can't remember where you are. Then slowly it comes back to you: you are in your own underground home set into the side of a hill which you have reached by ascending an enchanted teleportation tower in Hogsnorts School of Magic. You are in the best house - Hedgehog House - and you have a new best friend - Kensley Potato.
</p><p>You sigh with happiness. Yes, life is good right now.</p>
<p>But that reminds you: Kensley! She had her own Hogger-hole next door. You throw on your clothes as quickly as you can and dash down your tunnel to find her.</p>
<p>Just as you are running out of your door, you see Kensley dashing out of her door to come and find you.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur!&quot; she says, &quot;isn't this place so nice? I've got my own house in the hillside with polished chairs and pegs and everything!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But listen,&quot; she continues, not giving you the chance to reply. &quot;Why don't we stay here for the day instead of going for lessons? I'm sure no-one would notice if we weren't there. And I want to have a look around here first.&quot;</p><p></p>

Time for a change</h2>
<p>"I'm not sure I really fit in with my house," you say.
</p><p>&quot;Not the right house, eh?&quot; repeats Slumblebore. &quot;Well it wouldn't be the first time it has happened. Percy can pigeon hole people a bit too quickly at times - he is getting old now and sometimes I think his heart isn't really in it any more. Despite the fact that we feed him well and he gets to sing a song every year.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; you say, &quot;I think it just all happened too quickly when I arrived at the school and I didn't really know what it is was going to be <em>like</em> in Hedgehog House.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hmmm,&quot; ponders Slumblebore. &quot;With a bit more time you may come to like it, don't you think? You know that after Percy the Picking Pigeon has chosen your house you can't change it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No I'm never going to like it sir,&quot; you reply blinking back tears. &quot;I don't even like hedgehogs. I just pretended to, to fit in. I'll just be miserable my entire life.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well... in that case there is something I can do. I said that you can't change your house <em>after</em> you have chosen it but luckily I am something of an expert in temporal magic - the magic of time. I can send you back in time to <em>before</em> you have chosen your house and you can choose all over again. How about that Arthur?&quot;</p>
<p>You nod in reply. &quot;Yes thank you sir.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well then, just step into this clock over here...&quot; Slumblebore points to a large grandfather clock standing against the wall. The clock face is a little higher than your head and the main body of the clock has a small door, with a space behind that you can squeeze into.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm going to set the time to after dinner on the first night...&quot;</p>
<p>You can see Slumblebore's feet and flowing robes as he fiddles with the clock face above you.</p>
<p>&quot;When the clock strikes three you will travel back in time, and if I have got my calculations right, you will also travel sideways in space to arrive in the great hall at just the right time. Remember to come and see me again in my office later on. Or do I mean earlier on? The magic is starting soon now, good luck!&quot;</p>
<p>You can feel a tingling sensation as the magic travelling clock starts to power up. A faint sparkly golden glow feels the space that you are crouched in. You hear the clock strike one, two...</p><p></p>

The prophecy</h2>
<p>"Yes there is something I need to talk to you about Arthur, something very important," says Slumblebore. 
</p><p>&quot;Ever since the end of the last school term I have sensed an evil presence in the school. An evil presence that is growing stronger by the day. All that I have been able to determine is that it is coming from the school dungeons. But <em>what</em> it is and <em>where</em> exactly it is down there I do not know. Whatever it is, is beyond my power.&quot;</p>
<p>Slumblebore looks at you directly, his bushy eyebrows waggling.</p>
<p>&quot;This is where you come in Arthur. I need you to investigate what is going on in the dungeon. And deal with it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You want me to go to the dungeon!&quot; you ask, amazed. &quot;But you said at the school dinner that the dungeon was forbidden and no children were to go anywhere near!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes but Arthur don't you see? I can't just go around encouraging all the children to go down into the dungeons. There would be a stampede! And imagine if anything happened to them? Their parents would take Hogsnorts School to court, the fines could be crippling! No far better if you could just handle this quietly. And don't tell anyone that I told you to go down there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I don't know hardly any magic!&quot; you exclaim, &quot;I've only just started magic school!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I agree you should learn one or two spells before you venture down. Pay attention to your teachers! What they teach you could save your life.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But why me sir? Why not ask one of the older children to do it? Why don't <em>you</em> do it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There is one more thing I haven't told you Arthur. In the summer holidays I discovered an ancient prophecy concerning the school. It was written on a scroll that was so old that as soon as I touched it it turned to dust. It said:</p>
<div class="text-poem">
<p>'<em>When darkness falls across your school.
And evil threatens to rise and rule,<br>
When monsters lurk around school ground.
The boy called Arthur must be found.</em>'</p>
</div>
<p>&quot;Your coming has been foretold. If the prophecy is correct, only you can save us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And if you do this thing Arthur,&quot; Slumblebore adds, &quot;I will personally award one million points for Snakefang House.&quot;</p><p></p>

The wake up call</h2>
<p>As you wake, for a moment you are confused where you are. You can hear the sound of birds chirping through an open window and there is a faint woody aroma in the air. 
</p><p>Then, with a warm glow, you remember. You are in Ravenwing House Tower, and your new home-away-from-home is in the inside of a giant magical tree. As well as having the largest library in the history of the world (past and future), it also has a lovely en-suite bedroom just for you with a cosy living room attached. You sigh happily - the life of a wizard is not bad at all.</p>
<p>Then you remember that your new best friend Daniel Colliers-Wood also has a bedroom next door, so you throw your clothes on and dash out to find him.</p>
<p>As you run out of your room into the wooden corridor you see Daniel dashing along the corridor towards you.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur this tower is amazing! There's so much to see. Let's explore the Ravenwing tower today and skip our lessons.&quot;</p><p></p>

Night school</h2>
<p>Looking around you, you can see that you are at the junction of a number of stone corridors.
</p><p>One passageway has a sign above it saying &quot;Slumblebore's office this way&quot;.</p>
<p>Another one appears to lead downwards with a gentle slope.</p>
<p>A spiral staircase climbs up from another doorway. A little sign with an arrow reads: &quot;Your heart's desire's desire.&quot;</p>
<p>The new moon shines in from a tall narrow window.</p>
<p>You remember that the corridor to your left goes back to your house tower.</p>
<p>&quot;Where shall we go now Arthur?&quot; asks Kensley.</p><p></p>

The dungeon door</h2>
<p>As the other Lionpaw students file off into the corridor on their way to Lionpaw House tower you and Aaron quietly slip away to the side. After two or three turns of the passageway the noise of the other students has faded to nothing.
</p><p>&quot;Now where?&quot; asks Aaron.</p>
<p>You look around trying to get your bearings. You realise that the school is absolutely huge. There must be hundreds of corridors, archways, passageways and staircases. How will you even find the way to the dungeons?</p>
<p>Just then you notice five spiders walking along the floor, lined up one after the other. How odd, you think and start to follow them along the corridor.</p>
<p>They turn left, right, right again, then left before disappearing under a crack in the doorway.</p>
<p>You look up. Above the door is a sign scrawled in thick black letters: DUNGEONS.</p>
<p>&quot;We've made it,&quot; you whisper to Aaron, afraid to speak too loud in the silence. You reach out to turn the great brass doorknob and open the door. But it doesn't budge, and as you pull on the doorknob the edge of the door glows golden.</p>
<p>&quot;Look!&quot; says Aaron to you quietly, &quot;the door is enchanted. We'll never open it if we don't know the magic password.&quot;</p>
<p>At that moment you hear lots of footsteps coming your way from around a corner. It must be a group of students on their way to their house tower! Before you have time to hide, they turn the corner and spot you.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur and Aaron isn't it? What are you doing there? Come on get back into line!&quot; To your surprise you are addressed by one of the older Lionpaw students. You must have somehow taken a hidden shortcut when following the spiders.</p><p></p>

Professor Eric Knid</h2>
<p>Professor Eric Knid's classroom is on the ground floor, in a wing of Hogsnorts castle that sticks out a little from the main building. The windows look onto vegetable gardens on one side and some overgrown brambles on the other.
</p><p>You walk into the class with Snako and sit down. For this lesson Snakefang House first years have combined with Hedgehog House first years. Kensley Potato - a first year Hogger - sits down on your other side and starts fiddling with her pencil case.</p>
<p>Professor Knid stands at the front patiently while the children settle. His long arms and legs poke out of his wizard's gown. A strange shimmery cloak dangles from his shoulders. Dressed all in black he looks rather like an overgrown spider.</p>
<p>When there is silence he raises his hands. His odd looking cloak flutters around him while he speaks:</p>
<p>&quot;Today you will learn about the care of magical creatures.</p>
<p>&quot;But before we do that let me take this opportunity to remind you of Slumblebore's warning at the house sorting dinner.&quot; Professor Knid looks out at the class with a piercing gaze and it appears to you that his eyes are focused directly on you.</p>
<p>&quot;No-one must go into the dungeons this term. There is something mysterious and very probably dangerous down there this term, and no-one is allowed to interrupt. Is that clear?&quot;</p>
<p>Nods all round from the class. You exchange raised eyebrows with Snako. What could be going on down there? And why was Professor Knid staring straight at you?</p>
<p>&quot;Right!&quot; Knid claps his hands.&quot;Can anyone tell me the most common type of magical creature?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Unicorns?&quot; shouts out one boy.</p>
<p>&quot;Witches cats!&quot; shouts a girl at the back.</p>
<p>&quot;Flying monkeys!&quot; shouts someone else.</p>
<p>&quot;These are all good answers. But not correct. The most common type of magical creature is the insect, or, more generally: the arthropod. Spiders, snails, flies, ants, beetles, woodlice, these are all infinitely more common than the unicorn. And many of them have been enchanted by a magician or witch at some point in the past making them effectively immortal until trodden on.</p>
<p>&quot;For example, look closely at my cloak children.&quot; Eric Knid walks up and down the class so the children can see better.</p>
<p>You realise that the professor's cloak is not merely shimmering, it is <em>moving</em>. It seems to be made up of lots of tiny moving <em>things</em>. Then you realise what they are and your eyes widen in hideous fascination.</p>
<p>Eric Knid's cloak is made up of thousands upon thousands of flies, each fly grasping the flies next to it with their tiny hairy legs. As they flutter their wings or move their black and iridescent green bodies, the cloak appears to undulate as if in a breeze.</p>
<p>To you and the rest of the class it seems revolting, but Professor Knid is oblivious.</p>
<p>&quot;Until you look closely my cloak is just an ordinary magician's cape. But it is actually made up of thousands of enchanted and specially trained flies. And each one can fly off at my command to do my bidding - to deliver a message perhaps, or sit on someone's dinner, or to distract a powerful wizard in the act of casting a spell.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes the insect world is a vast and overlooked wonder and in this lesson I am going to teach you about a tiny portion of it.</p>
<p>&quot;But before we learn any magic, does anyone doubt me that the arthropods - the insects - are the true marvels of the animal world?&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Knid looks round expectantly, his eyebrows raised.</p><p></p>

Battle rage</h2>
<p>"Die beetles, die!" you cry, running towards the three giant bombardier beetles. 
</p><p>In your battle rage you forget all about magic and your wand, you just want to reach the beetles and grapple them with your bare hands, mano a beetlo.</p>
<p>&quot;Yaaaah!&quot; you cry, closing the distance fast...</p>
<p>...but not fast enough. The three beetles swiftly raise up their bottoms, and shoot out three streams of superheated acid, accompanied by three loud popping sounds.</p>
<p>One stream misses your head by inches, another strikes the wall beside you, the third the floor in front.</p>
<p>&quot;Hahahaha, you'll never get me for I dance the dance of...&quot;</p>
<p>But you never get the chance to tell them exactly what dance it is you are dancing because at that moment your foot slips on the pool of acid on the floor and slides out from underneath you. You fly through the air very briefly before slamming into the floor, bumping your head hard enough to knock you out cold.</p><p></p>

<p>The spider web doesn't budge an inch.</p>
<p>&quot;That doesn't <em>sound</em> like a real spell Arthur,&quot; says Kensley. &quot;Did you just make it up?&quot;</p>

The heart of the dungeon</h2>
<p>You remember that woodlice are one of the few creatures that are completely immune to magic of any kind, and decide to cast a heat spell to clear a path indirectly.
</p><p>You raise your wand. &quot;Fiel fresa fusila fuego!&quot;</p>
<p>A magical flame whooshes out of your wand, sending golden sparks shooting.</p>
<p>The flame doesn't harm the woodlice, but it heats the air, and dries it. The woodlice have no option but to retreat: without moisture they can't absorb oxygen, they would suffocate.</p>
<p>This leaves a path.</p>
<p>You breathe deeply and plunge forwards past the woodlouse army who are retreating into the still moist cracks in the stone.</p>
<p>After walking further down the dank, chilly passage you and Daniel come to a door made of iron bars.</p>
<p>Just beyond you can hear a faint murmur of voices.</p>
<p>This is it: the heart of the dungeon. Whoever or whatever has been setting these traps for you and Daniel must be here, at the bottom of it all.</p><p></p>

Just in time</h2>
<p>You leap out of the clock just in time, you could already feel the magic sucking you down.
</p><p>Breathing hard you look back at the clock face and see the hands of the clock spinning madly backwards.</p>
<p>&quot;You have changed your mind about changing your mind have you?&quot; Slumblebore observes, his bushy eyebrows waggling. &quot;Well you can come and see me at any time and change your mind again if you want.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I... I... I think I don't want to leave Ravenwing just yet,&quot; you stammer. You are not quite sure why you changed your mind at the last minute, but it just didn't feel... right.</p>
<p>&quot;Well as you are not going anywhere just yet, let's get talking about the problem we have right now,&quot; says Slumblebore. &quot;I'm talking of course about what we are going to do about the evil presence in the school dungeon. I fear it is something that may threaten the very existence of Hogsnorts.&quot;</p><p></p>

The dark web</h2>
<p>You and Snako start pushing at the spider web with your hands.
</p><p>It is amazingly strong and also <em>sticky</em>. When you push a strand it becomes harder and harder to unstick your hands.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur&quot;, cries Snako, &quot;I'm stuck!&quot;</p>
<p>You turn to the side and see that somehow Snako has got himself totally tangled up in the web - he is hanging upside down with spider webs curled round his ankles and his hair brushing the floor.</p>
<p>&quot;Hang in there Snako, I'm going to see if I can get through!&quot; you reply but as you try to move over towards Snako you feel thick ropes of spider web curl around your legs and lift you up into the air. In an instant you are as helpless as Snako.</p>
<p>You feel your panic rising as you struggle. Who is going to help you now? No-one even knows that you are here except perhaps Slumblebore.</p>
<p>&quot;Aaargh! Look Arthur - spiders! Millions of spiders!&quot;</p>
<p>Snako is right. Crawling out of the cracks of the walls, floor and ceiling is a host of spiders. They scurry along the webs heading for you and Snako. In a sudden insight you realise that these spiders have made the webs themselves, working as a one enormous team to add strand after strand of spider silk until they had created these rope-thick cobwebs. So many spiders working as one! What could they not achieve together?</p>
<p>Then all thoughts flee from your mind as the wave of spiders reach you. They stop inches away.</p>
<p>One lone spider - no bigger than the rest - scuttles out of the pack, delicately steps onto your robes then up to your neck. You see a flash of tiny fangs then you fade into unconsciousness.</p><p></p>

Jape&#39;s spell</h2>
<p>Along with most of the other children you keep your hands down.
</p><p>&quot;You don't want to hear my jokes? Well I never!&quot; Professor Jape looks genuinely hurt for a moment, but quickly recovers his composure.</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps you will be laughing on the other side of your face by the end of this lesson.&quot; Jape gives another high pitched giggle and you all shift on your seats uneasily.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe,&quot; he continues, &quot;you will enjoy this one. I need a volunteer!&quot;</p>
<p>No one volunteers so Jape scans the classroom. He points at Daniel.</p>
<p>&quot;You! Come forward.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel walks to the front of the class looking nervous.</p>
<p>Without any warning Professor Jape whips out his wand, points it at Daniel and yells: &quot;<em>Vamos varita vencer vistosamente!</em>&quot;</p>
<p>A golden light extrudes from the tip of Jape's wand. The light looks like a solid sparkly golden beam and extends for one metre then stops emerging. Jape swings his wand around and you realise that he has created a magical golden light sword! As the golden beam swipes through the air it makes satisfying swishing zoom noises.</p>
<p>&quot;En guard!&quot; snaps Jape to Daniel with a gleam in his eye before suddenly launching into a frenzied attack, swiping left and right with his light sword. In a flash he has covered the 5 metres to Daniel and he holds the light sword directly at Daniel's throat.</p>
<p>&quot;Now you will die.&quot; Jape says simply.</p>
<p>There is dead silence in the class. Everyone is holding their breath.</p>
<p>Then, almost in exact unison, everyone screams and runs out of the door, except Daniel who is rooted to the spot in fear, and you because you don't want to abandon your friend.</p>
<p>Professor Jape lowers the light sword and gives a high pitched giggle.</p>
<p>&quot;I were just joking, didn't you know that?&quot; he said to the fleeing children. &quot;It were just a joke!&quot; he shouted louder at their fleeing backs.</p>
<p>Professor Jape sighs and says to you and Daniel: &quot;They can't take a joke, can they? Well lessons over now I suppose. But remember: <em>Vamos varita vencer vistosamente</em> that's a good one that is!&quot;</p>
<p>You and Daniel nod and swallow, and without saying another word, flee out of the classroom.</p><p></p>

<p>Professor Knid looks round expectantly, his eyebrows raised.</p><p></p>

Lessons finished for the day</h2>
<p>Making sure that you have got all of your quills, ink bottles, spell books and sweets, you put your bag on your shoulder and leave the Great Hall to go back to the House Tower with Daniel.
</p><p>Strangely enough you find you can remember the way back there easily - the path had seemed so long and winding on your first day. Perhaps it was something to do with eating the Ravenwing Egg from Percy the Picking Pigeon that has given you a homing instinct for the Tower.</p>
<p>When you arrive you head straight to the Ravenwing House reading room, instructing one of the enchanted parrots to fetch you some light reading from the shelves. Settling into a comfy armchair you read a couple of Kafka short stories, briefly ponder life as a giant cockroach, then turn to Daniel who is reading his own book on the armchair beside you.</p><p></p>

Inner peace</h2>
<p>"I'm Arthur Otley and I want to learn some spells" you say to Professor Blavatsky.
</p><p>&quot;Ah so impatient. And yet this impatience stops you learning about yourself. I can see that you are very far from self control as yet.&quot;</p>
<p>The teacher stands up and raises one hand.</p>
<p>&quot;But do not worry, any of you. Because we will start with a simple meditation session to help you gain control.&quot;</p>
<p>You groan inwardly. This sounds boring.</p>
<p>&quot;Close your eyes everyone,&quot; begins Professor Blavatsky. &quot;Make sure you are comfortable in your seats. Now I want you to focus on your breathing. Breathe in. Breathe out. Breathe in... and breathe out.</p>
<p>&quot;Feel the breath flowing into your nostrils. Concentrate on the sensation. Do you feel your nose hairs tickling? Perhaps a small bogey flapping around in your nasal passage? Just think about the breath, how it feels.&quot;</p>
<p>Despite yourself you feel your awareness sharpening, and you do indeed feel a small bogey in your nostril wobbling around as you breathe in and out.</p>
<p>&quot;Now I want you to think about a special number. The special number is 42. A four and then a two. Forty two. This number is not just a number it is also a place. A location. A place of calm that you can always turn to in moments of difficulty or stress.</p>
<p>&quot;This number 42 is a place within yourself, but it is a real place too that anyone can reach, if they just turn to that number... the number 42. As you turn to 42, just keep your thumb here so you know where to come back to.&quot;</p>
<p>Amazingly you feel a sensation as if you are floating somehow, except with your thumb stuck down in front of you. Concentrating fiercely you try with all your might to turn to 42. You float away...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&quot;Did anyone manage to meditate and reach 42?&quot; asks Madam Blavatsky.</p>
<p>You definitely feel you went... somewhere. You <em>think</em> this is what Professor Blavatsky meant.</p>
<p>&quot;Any time you find yourself in need of quiet and peace, just repeat this meditation exercise and think of the number 42 and you will find a place of calm and relaxation - but keep your thumb right where you are and you will be able to turn back whenever you want.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Class dismissed! We will meet again.&quot;</p><p></p>

Professor Eric Knid Explains</h2>
<p>A voice, strong and commanding, emerges from the darkness. "You? The saviour, a mere stripling first year? Impossible!"  
</p><p>Another voice, high pitched and chittery, answers him. &quot;Yes Eric, this is him. He is the wand holder.&quot;</p>
<p>As your eyes adjust to the gloom, you can make out a figure standing in the centre of the room. A wizard - and someone you recognise.</p>
<p>&quot;Professor Knid! But what...?&quot; you exclaim.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes Professor Eric Knid at your service! Or perhaps I should say that you will be at my service... Arthur isn't it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes my name's Arthur. Arthur Otley.&quot; A sensation of fear congeals in your throat so strong that you can barely speak. &quot;What do you mean? And who were you talking to just now?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All in good time, Arthur...&quot; with an unexpectedly swift movement Professor Knid draws his wand and shoots a spell of locking at the iron gate which... swings shut and then hits some invisible object and swings open again. There is a curious noise like a muffled cry, and then finally the clangs shut.</p>
<p>But there is no time to worry about the curious muffled cry - you are trapped.</p>
<p>&quot;What are you going to do?&quot; you exclaim in a fearful high pitched squeak.</p>
<p>Eric Knid smiled. Even in the dark you can see the mad gleam in his eye: &quot;Revolution!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Explain why Eric.&quot; That chittering voice again, appearing out of nowhere.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes - why. Why?&quot; Professor Knid takes a deep breath. &quot;Ever since I was a young boy Arthur I have felt an affinity with insects, spiders, crabs. With the Arthropods. A dog will bite you, not so an earwig! A lion may eat you, not so a woodlouse! A human may betray you, a spider will not.</p>
<p>&quot;My faithful friends growing up were slugs, ants, flies and beetles. But my friends were mercilessly crushed, poisoned, and swatted by humans.</p>
<p>&quot;The final straw? Slumblebore sat on a spider - and laughed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I couldn't bear it. I sought out the Great Spider King Azog himself. What joy when I found him in the forbidden bushes and entered his service. Together we have been gathering supporters here in this dungeon, insects and spiders in their millions. For revenge. For a revolution. To take over the school!</p>
<p>&quot;No longer will it just be Lionpaw House, Ravenwing House, Snakefang House, and Hedgehog House! We will have a new house mightier than all of them. The Order of the Arthropods! And I will be headmaster.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But why me?&quot; fear chills you. &quot;I'm just a first year, I don't want any trouble.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are the only one who can stop us Arthur,&quot; says the mysterious high pitched voice. &quot;But with you on our side we will be invincible!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who is that?&quot; you cry.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the Great Spider King Azog himself. And you are honoured to stand in his presence.&quot; Professor Knid explains.</p>
<p>&quot;Where?&quot; You can't see anyone other than the Professor.</p>
<p>&quot;Here!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where, I can't see!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right here, look! Closer!&quot;</p><p></p>

Beetle battle</h2>
<p>You find yourself face to face with a trio of bombardier beetles, who seem to be guarding the way. 
</p><p>&quot;My goodness!&quot; says Kensley. &quot;They are not friendly one bit!&quot;</p>
<p>One of them makes an angry chittering sound. Even though you don't speak beetle you are pretty sure this beetle doesn't like you.</p>
<p>The three beetles turn around in the corridor to face away from you.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur do you think they're running away?&quot; asks Kensley, tugging on your sleeve.</p>
<p>Suddenly there is a loud popping sound and a steam of superheated liquid shoots out of the beetles' bottoms.</p>
<p>&quot;Duck!&quot; you cry, and you and Kensely throw yourself to one side. The liquid misses you by inches. The stone flagstone bubbles and fizzes where the liquid struck it.</p>
<p>You both pick yourself up off the floor and scramble back round the corner for safety.</p>
<p>&quot;That was too close,&quot; you say. &quot;We need to get past those creatures or we will never be able to get down into the dungeon.&quot;</p>
<p>You think hard, there must be a spell that you can use. Some spell that allows you to sneak past without them seeing you.</p>
<p>After a moment, a determined look in your eye, you step out from your hiding place with your wand at the ready.</p><p></p>

Woodlouse warfare</h2>
<p>"Somnolencia salchicha sabrosa," you cry, brandishing your wand fiercely.
</p><p>A surge of magical power flows through your body, down your arm and out through the wand. A shower of golden sparks races down the corridor raining down onto the three beetles.</p>
<p>Each beetle glows gold for an instant before slowly rolling onto their side and then their backs, six legs waggling gently in the air.</p>
<p>&quot;Did you kill them?&quot; asks Snako.</p>
<p>&quot;No I decided to spare their lives - they could be useful to me later. That was a sleeping spell. Look you can see their legs are still moving.&quot;</p>
<p>They must be dreaming some pleasant beetle dream, perhaps of cantering through a leafy carboniferous glade, as their legs make little wiggles in the air.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's get past them before they wake up.&quot;</p>
<p>You and Snako step over the sleeping beetles, giving them a kick as you walk past. That will teach them for attacking you.</p>
<p>You descend a spiral staircase now and the air is getting dank and stale. It can't be long before you arrive in the dungeon.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the staircase it is pitch black.</p>
<p>You raise your wand and the tip emits a faint golden light, just enough to see by.</p>
<p>You almost wish you hadn't.</p>
<p>Revealed by the dim light of your wand you can see the floor and the walls are completely covered in woodlice. Millions upon millions of them cling to the damp stone slabs that make up the corridor. Millions more cover the flagstones, waving their repulsive little antennae. Others have curled up into balls and are rolling around irresponsibly.</p>
<p>Do woodlice even have eyes? You don't know but when you turned on your light they all seemed to turn and look at you.</p>
<p>&quot;Slithering snakebites Arthur, what are we going to do? There are too many of them to fight!&quot;</p>

A silly idea</h2>
<p>"Tonto tijeras trae tiempo!" you shout out, waving your wand above your head.
</p><p>To your surprise, a golden pair of magical scissors shoots out of the end of your wand and strikes the ceiling, and golden threads arch through the stone above your head.</p>
<p>From the golden filaments in the roof, a flutter of beautiful golden snowflakes fall. Each one has an exquisitely perfect hexagonal symmetry.</p>
<p>When they land on your arms and head, they give you a warm tingling sensation and then disappear with a tinkling sound, like a tiny bell.</p>
<p>After a few moments the golden snow fall stops and the corridor returns to its previous gloomy state.</p>
<p>&quot;Wow that was amazing Arthur&quot; says Aaron. &quot;I don't know how you did that. But I'm afraid it doesn't help us with the spider web.</p><p></p>

School hero</h2>
<p>It takes you just an instant to decide. 
</p><p>Whipping out your wand you cry &quot;Fiel fresa fusila fuego!&quot; and flames shoot out, bathing the dungeon in flickering light. Not while you still have a clear head and a straight wand will you let these insects take over! You are going to fight them every step of the way, starting with Azog!</p>
<p>Azog is too nimble to be caught so easily though and leaps out of the way.</p>
<p>&quot;You will regret your choice Arthur,&quot; screams the spider king in outrage. &quot;Insects, attack!&quot;</p>
<p>From out of cracks in the walls, ceiling and floor crawl millions upon millions of arthropods: beetles, woodlice, ants, millipedes, earwigs, spiders in a great stream heading straight for you.</p>
<p>This time you don't hesitate. If you stay you will be surrounded and overwhelmed.</p>
<p>&quot;Daniel, run!&quot; you say as you turn and flee.</p>
<p>Your heart pounding, you and Daniel run back out of the dungeon up towards the school. You have a plan.</p>
<p>When you reach the enchanted door that leads down into the dungeon you dash through, Daniel just behind you, and slam it shut. You can hear the enchanted locking mechanism clicking shut.</p>
<p>There's only one way for the insects to get past the door now - through the keyhole. You turn and wait, your wand at the ready. Daniel stands next to you, prepared.</p>
<p>As soon as you see the first hairy little leg poking out of the keyhole you use your wand as a flamethrower shouting &quot;fiel fresa fusila fuego&quot; again and again until your voice is hoarse. Daniel joins you adding his flames to yours.</p>
<p>The air is full of the harsh high pitched cries of dying arthropods and the sizzle of roasting chitin. But still the insects come, propelled onwards by the Great Azog's iron will.</p>
<p>You and Daniel are getting tired now, your arm is sore from being held up so long and you can feel your reserves of magical energy running out. You cannot hold out much longer.</p>
<p>For a moment the magical fire from your wand flickers and dies.</p>
<p>Then three things happen simultaneously:</p>
<p>One: Azog, sensing his chance, launches himself through the keyhole aiming straight for your face.</p>
<p>Two: Slumblebore runs round the corner to see you battling the numberless insect foe on your own.</p>
<p>Three: your faltering spell was a ruse. You have enough magical power for one last enchantment, but this time it won't be a fireball...</p>
<p>&quot;Somnolencia salchicha sabrosa!&quot; you cry pointing at your wand at Azog as he flies through the air towards you.</p>
<p>Then...</p>
<p>Azog, leaping through the air fangs at the ready, is unable to change direction. Just as your wand arm comes <em>up</em> he reaches the tip of the wand, and has no time to avoid the sleep spell which blasts him right in the middle of his eight little compound eyes.</p>
<p>Even the great Azog cannot withstand such a concentrated blast of magic at point blank range. He is blasted backwards, fast asleep and snoring before he even hits the stone wall behind him.</p>
<p>With Azog out of action the rest of the arthropod horde lose all cohesion. When Slumblebore cautiously opens the door to the dungeon they are fleeing in all directions, and will trouble the school no more. Slumblebore lets off a few more blasts of fire to encourage them on their way.</p>
<p>&quot;You did it Arthur!&quot; cries Daniel. &quot;You saved the school - the evil has gone - and you have captured Azog alive!&quot;</p>
<p>You stand still and listen carefully. Daniel is right. You cannot sense the insects any longer. The dungeons have been cleansed.</p>
<p>&quot;Well done indeed Arthur,&quot; and Slumblebore, turning back to you. &quot;I had a feeling that you were the special one. Without you I fear we would have been overrun by insects by now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was Eric Knid,&quot; you say to Slumblebore. &quot;It was Professor Knid who summoned the insect army, with Azog the spider king. He is down in the dungeon now unconscious. Azog bit him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Eric did you say? Well I'm not surprised. He always struck me as a bit of an odd fish. Nevermind we will pick him up in the morning and I shall give him an official reprimand. And if he does it again I will have no choice but to put him on a performance improvement plan.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But you Arthur, what else can I give <em>you</em> but my most heartfelt thanks.&quot; You can't suppress a broad grin. You did it! You defeated Azog and his insect army single handed, using your magical strength and cleverness!</p>
<p>Slumbelbore continues: &quot;You truly are a hero Arthur, a hero of Hogsnorts School.&quot;</p><p></p>

<p>You leap out of the clock just in time, you could already feel the magic sucking you down.
</p><p>Breathing hard you look back at the clock face and see the hands of the clock spinning madly backwards.</p>
<p>&quot;You have changed your mind about changing your mind have you?&quot; Slumblebore observes, his bushy eyebrows raised. &quot;Well you can come and see me at any time and change your mind again if you want.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I... I... Thank you sir,&quot; you stammer. You are not quite sure why you changed your mind at the last minute, but it just didn't feel... right.</p>
<p>&quot;Well as you are not going anywhere just yet, let's get talking about the problem we have right now,&quot; says Slumblebore. &quot;I'm talking of course about what we are going to do about the evil presence in the school dungeon. I fear it is something that may threaten the very existence of Hogsnorts.&quot;</p><p></p>

The dungeon door</h2>
<p>As the other Snakefang students file off into the corridor on their way to Snakefang House tower, you and Snako quietly sneak away to the side. After two or three turns of the passageway the noise of the other students has faded to nothing.
</p><p>&quot;Now where?&quot; asks Snako, a tremor of fear and excitement in his voice.</p>
<p>You look around trying to get your bearings. You realise that the school is absolutely huge. There must be hundreds of corridors, archways, passageways and staircases. How will you even find the way to the dungeons?</p>
<p>Just then you notice five spiders walking along the floor, lined up one after the other. What are those disgusting looking creatures up to? you think and start to follow them along the corridor.</p>
<p>They turn left, right, right again, then left before disappearing under a crack in the doorway.</p>
<p>You look up. Above the door is a sign scrawled in thick black letters: DUNGEONS.</p>
<p>&quot;This is it!&quot; you whisper to Snako, afraid to speak too loud in the silence. You reach out to turn the great brass doorknob and open the door. But it doesn't budge, and as you pull on the doorknob the edge of the door glows golden.</p>
<p>&quot;Look!&quot; says Snako to you quietly, &quot;I know what the problem is: the door is enchanted. We'll never open it if we don't know the magic password.&quot;</p>
<p>At that moment you hear lots of footsteps coming your way from around a corner. It must be a group of students on their way to their house tower! Before you have time to hide, they turn the corner and spot you.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur and Snako isn't it? What are you doing there you miserable little sneakers? Get back into line!&quot; To your surprise you are addressed by one of the older Snakefang students. You must have somehow taken a hidden shortcut when following the spiders.</p><p></p>

Epilogue</h2>
<p>Still with the ring on, you creep back around the Hall and take your place next to the other Hedgehog students. Then you remove the ring, put it in your pocket and pretend that you were sitting there all along.
</p><p>&quot;Where's he gone, that disgusting talking spider?&quot; shouts a boy called Snako from Snakefang house, standing to his feet.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes what's happened to him?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where did he go?&quot;</p>
<p>The insect army, no longer under Azog's powerful enchantment, start milling about like normal insects. Sensing their confusion the students leap to their feet and start squashing insects left right and centre. The arthropod survivors flee into cracks and are gone.</p>
<p>You find Kensley in the crowd.</p>
<p>&quot;Slumblebore couldn't stop them!&quot; she says. &quot;When we got to the dungeon door the insects overpowered him, it was horrible. But where did you come from Arthur? And what has happened to the spider king?&quot;</p>
<p>You shrug your shoulders, give her an enigmatic smile and say nothing.</p>
<p>In not much more than half an hour order is restored: the teachers are cut down and the flattened carcass of the Great Azog  - all that remained after you trod on him - has been scraped off the stage floor.</p>
<p>Slumblebore raises his hands for silence and addresses the students in a slightly shaky voice.</p>
<p>&quot;Students! It appears that my warnings were prescient - there was indeed a terrible doom brewing in the school dungeon. Even now I am not sure how our doom was averted. But be that as it may, everything is now back to normal. So back to your beds, get a good night's rest, and never speak of this again. Particularly not to your parents. Goodnight!&quot;</p>
<p>You take Kensley by the arm and walk companionably back to the Hedgehog House Tower, then up onto the hillside and into your Hogger Hole.</p>
<p>&quot;Goodnight Kensley!&quot; you say.</p>
<p>&quot;Goodnight Arthur!&quot; she replies.</p>
<p>Then you step through the front door of your cosy Hogger Hole and look around you. Everything is exactly as you left it: comfortable varnished chairs, stout walking stick by the door, umbrella in the umbrella stand. You take the magic golden ring out of your pocket, flick it up into the air happily and catch it as it falls.</p>
<p>You let out a large, contented sigh. Yes, everything is back to normal.</p>
<p>CONGRATULATIONS YOU HAVE ACHIEVED THE EVERYTHING IS BACK TO NORMAL ENDING!</p><p></p>

Time for a change</h2>
<p>"I'm not sure I really fit in with my house," you say.
</p><p>&quot;Not the right house, eh?&quot; repeats Slumblebore. &quot;Well it wouldn't be the first time it has happened. Percy can pigeon hole people a bit too quickly at times - he is getting old now and sometimes I think his heart isn't really in it any more. Despite the fact that we feed him well and he gets to sing a song every year.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; you say, &quot;I think it just all happened too quickly when I arrived at the school and I didn't really know what it is was going to be <em>like</em> in Snakefang House.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hmmm,&quot; ponders Slumblebore. &quot;With a bit more time you may come to like it, don't you think? You know that after Percy the Picking Pigeon has chosen your house you can't change it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No I'm never going to like it sir,&quot; you reply blinking back tears. &quot;I don't even like snakes. I just pretended to, to fit in. I'll just be miserable my entire life.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well... in that case there is something I can do. I said that you can't change your house <em>after</em> you have chosen it but luckily I am something of an expert in temporal magic - the magic of time. I can send you back in time to <em>before</em> you have chosen your house and you can choose all over again. How about that Arthur?&quot;</p>
<p>You nod in reply. &quot;Yes thank you sir.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well then, just step into this clock over here...&quot; Slumblebore points to a large grandfather clock standing against the wall. The clock face is a little higher than your head and the main body of the clock has a small door, with a space behind that you can squeeze into.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm going to set the time to after dinner on the first night...&quot;</p>
<p>You can see Slumblebore's feet and flowing robes as he fiddles with the clock face above you.</p>
<p>&quot;When the clock strikes three you will travel back in time, and if I have got my calculations right, you will also travel sideways in space to arrive in the great hall at just the right time. Remember to come and see me again in my office later on. Or do I mean earlier on? The magic is starting soon now, good luck!&quot;</p>
<p>You can feel a tingling sensation as the magic travelling clock starts to power up. A faint sparkly golden glow feels the space that you are crouched in. You hear the clock strike one, two...</p><p></p>

<p>"I will do it, though I do not know how," you say. 
</p><p>&quot;My dear Arthur! Students really are amazing creatures. You can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a day and yet after a hundred years they can still surprise you.&quot; Slumblebore regards you with twinkling eyes and chuckles.</p>
<p>&quot;As to the how: first you must deactivate the locking spell on the dungeon door with the magic password: watermelon.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Watermelon?&quot; you repeat.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes: watermelon. I chose this password because it is my favourite fruit. Then you must descend the staircase that leads down into the very depths of the school. In the past students would be imprisoned in the dungeons for misbehaviour. Now they are mainly used to store broken chairs and Christmas decorations. But we go down there so infrequently there is no telling what evil is brewing in some dark corner.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I advise you to keep your wand at the ready and your wits sharp Arthur. And remember all the lessons the teachers have taught you. You will be put to the test and I do not know how it will turn out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sir,&quot; you ask. &quot;What do you <em>think</em> is down there?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Long have I studied this question, seeking knowledge in ancient scrolls and consulting with the wisest of the wise. Not a sausage. All I can say is that in the dead of night when I listen hard at the dungeon door I can sometimes hear a faint scratching noise... like the sound of a million claws far away, scratching and scrabbling at something. Either that or some mice eating a hole in the skirting board.&quot;</p><p></p>

Taking cover</h2>
<p>Dashing round the corner you raise your wand and yell "Paraguas pronto!"
</p><p>To your astonishment, from the end of your wand pops out a translucent sparkly golden umbrella.</p>
<p>In a flash it opens up - it is big enough to cover both you and Daniel, which is just as well because in that same moment there is another popping sound and three more splotches of superheated acid from the beetles’ bottoms fly through the air towards you.</p>
<p>Splat splat splat!</p>
<p>The acid hits the magical golden umbrella, protecting you from harm.</p>
<p>But not the golden umbrella. In a few moments the acid has dissolved it to nothing, just a little bit of umbrella handle is left poking out of the end of your wand.</p>
<p>The three giant bombardier beetles raise their rear ends at you, and make menacing chittering noises.</p>
<p>&quot;Retreat!&quot; shouts Daniel, &quot;we're sitting ducks!&quot;</p>

<p>Looking around you, you can see that you are at the junction of a number of stone corridors.
</p><p>One passageway has a sign above it saying &quot;Slumblebore's office this way&quot;.</p>
<p>Another one appears to lead downwards with a gentle slope.</p>
<p>A spiral staircase climbs up from another doorway. A little sign with an arrow reads: &quot;Your heart's desire's desire.&quot;</p>
<p>The new moon shines in from a tall narrow window.</p>

<p>"Let's go back to the House Tower," you say to Snako. "I'm tired out, it must be really late now."
</p><p>The two of you trudge wearily back to the Snakefang House Tower. It is a long way but somehow you remember the path perfectly - perhaps due to some 'homing' magic that all Snakefang's absorb when they first go to the Tower.</p>
<p>Before long you have found your way through the winding pathways and are back next to the lava pool at the centre of Snakefang Tower. The glow of the lava lights everything up an eerie orange colour and Blood Drinker and the other giant snakes are basking next to the pool in the heat. Your nose catches a faint whiff of sulphur as you turn your head to follow the line of the stone staircase winding round the inside of this huge tower to the door of your own personal mini tower.</p>
<p>You feel your spirits lift: could anyone have a better home to come back to than this?</p>
<p>&quot;Night night Arthur,&quot; says Snako with a yawn. &quot;See you in the morning.&quot;</p>
<p>You both wearily climb the final stone staircase to your towers, unlock the doors with your wands, and enter.</p>
<p>Throwing your robes over the sofa, you have a quick refreshing shower in your bathroom, dry yourself with an enormous fluffy midnight-black towel, climb the spiral staircase to your cosy little bedroom at the top of your tower and drift peacefully off to sleep.</p><p></p>

<p>&quot;Now then children!&quot; Professor Jape calls out at the front of the class. &quot;Now then, now then! It's so lovely to meet you all.&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Jape is wearing a black cape with a red velvet lining and has a very pale almost white face. He smiles at the class warmly and gives a little wink.</p>
<p>&quot;Today we are going to learn some offensive magic. Now as you probably know offensive magic can be extremely dangerous. But that's not to say we can't have a bit of a laugh and a giggle as we go along eh? Eh children? Eh?&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Jape makes a loud high pitched giggling noise. Some of the other children laugh back nervously.</p>

Woodlouse warfare</h2>
<p>"Somnolencia salchicha sabrosa," you cry, waving your wand about energetically.
</p><p>You feel a tingly sensation waft down your arm and out through your wand. A beautiful shower of golden sparks pours out from the tip and arcs down the corridor raining down onto the three beetles.</p>
<p>Each beetle glows gold for an instant before slowly rolling onto their side and then their backs, six legs waggling gently in the air.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you think they are ok?&quot; asks Kensley.</p>
<p>&quot;They... they seem to be. That was a sleeping spell. Look you can see their legs are still moving.&quot;</p>
<p>They must be dreaming some pleasant beetle dream, perhaps of cantering through a leafy carboniferous glade, as their legs make little wiggles in the air.</p>
<p>&quot;Come on Kensley, let's tip toe past them before they wake up.&quot;</p>
<p>You and Kensley carefully walk around the sleeping beetles.</p>
<p>You descend a spiral staircase now and the air is getting dank and stale. It can't be long before you arrive in the dungeon.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the staircase it is pitch black.</p>
<p>You raise your wand and the tip emits a faint golden light, just enough to see by.</p>
<p>You can't stop yourself emitting an involuntary gibber.</p>
<p>Revealed by the dim light of your wand you can see the floor and the walls are completely covered in woodlice. Millions upon millions of them cling to the damp stone slabs that make up the corridor. Millions more cover the flagstones, waving their repulsive little antennae. Others have curled up into balls and are rolling around irresponsibly.</p>
<p>Do woodlice even have eyes? You don't know but when you turned on your light they all seemed to turn and look at you.</p>
<p>&quot;Holy hedgehogs!&quot; says Kensley, a tremor of fear in her voice. &quot;Arthur, what are we going to do? There is no way we can get past so many of them!&quot;</p>

A fishy spell</h2>
<p>Surveying the hordes of woodlice in front of you, you raise your wand up high and cry out in a loud voice: 
</p><p>&quot;Amansa atún!&quot;</p>
<p>For a moment nothing happens.</p>
<p>Then three glimmering golden bubbles expand into the air in front of you, until they are the size of footballs. Inside each golden bubble is a large golden fish. The fish flap their fins and smile at you happily.</p>
<p>&quot;What is that spell?&quot; Daniel asks you.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not entirely sure, I was hoping it would be a whirlwind or lightning strike or something along those lines.&quot;</p>
<p>The golden bubbles pop and the three fish flop to the floor with a surprised look on their faces and then disappear with another pop.</p>
<p>The woodlice look on, unimpressed.</p><p></p>

<p>As you shout "Watermelon!" at the top of your voice, you point your wand at the door.
</p><p>You can feel your arm channel powerful magic. Magical golden lines leap from the tip of the wand. The golden lines strike the door and entwine the handle, the hinges, the iron bands that hold the door together.</p>
<p>An enchantingly clear note sounds and at the same time the dungeon door swings open.</p>
<p>&quot;You did it Arthur!&quot; cries Snako, and the two of you enter the passageway, wands at the ready.</p>

Bunking off</h2>
<p>"Great!" replies Kensley. "Let's start by exploring your hole."
</p><p>You inspect every room in your Hogger-hole carefully, and find that everything you could possibly need has been stowed away: food, spare clothes, pots and pans, a hoover, cutlery, salt and pepper, spare bin bags, washing up liquid - the place is amazing.</p>
<p>You discover that one of the rooms functions as a little shed with gardening equipment in it, compost and seeds. Kensley is delighted to find a bag of seed potatoes at the back, still in good condition.</p>
<p>Kensley and you immediately set to work in the small garden at the front of your house, clearing more space for the flowers by pulling up brambles, trimming the grass and making a little vegetable plot, where you plant out the potatoes you found.</p>
<p>Feeling tired you go to your kitchen and make a pot of tea and rummage out some seed cake and a few scones, with pots of strawberry jam and clotted cream. You and Kensley sit on little wooden chairs in the front garden in the sun, and eagerly chomp your way through the delicious food and sip hot tea.</p>
<p>Refreshed you turn to Kensley: &quot;What do you say to a little ramble?&quot;</p>
<p>Both of you stroll along the path among the Hogger-holes in the side of the hill. Most of the students have gone to their lessons but there are a few who have decided to stay behind to weed their gardens or just sit and enjoy the autumn sunshine, and you greet them as you go by.</p>
<p>&quot;Good morning Brian Banana.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pleased to make your acquaintance Rebecca Radishbottom.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How do you do Betty Appleton?&quot;</p>
<p>Everyone is friendly and happy to see you even though this is your and Kensley's first day as Hoggers.</p>
<p>You stroll down to a river at the bottom of the hill and spend a moment watching the sunlight sparkle on the water. Then you notice some flat pebbles on the riverbank and you take turns skimming them across the river.</p>
<p>&quot;Four bounces Kensley, that's a record!&quot; you cry in triumph.</p>
<p>&quot;You liar. That was never four, the last bounce was a sink,&quot; she says with a smile.</p>
<p>&quot;It was four bounces, I saw the splashes!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh yeah, well how about this for a splash!&quot;</p>
<p>With that Kensley gives you a playful but firm push and you topple backwards into the water.</p>
<p>For a moment you are submerged, and as you scrabble for something to hold onto, your hand touches something. Something small and hard - you close your fist instinctively. When you come up to the surface you realise you are holding a beautiful shiny golden ring.</p>
<p>As you climb onto the river bank dripping water Kensley announces that it is her birthday. This is a bit unexpected but, making the best of it, you decide that jewellery usually goes down well as a present, and give her the golden ring.</p>
<p>&quot;Happy birthday!&quot; you say. Kensley says nothing in reply and slips the ring into a hidden pocket with a sly look on her face. What odd behaviour! you say to yourself.</p>
<p>Then it's off to the hole to get changed into dry clothes, putting your wet and muddy clothes from the river into the enchanted washing bucket, and reciting the 40 degrees wash incantation.</p>
<p>Then to Kensley's house for dinner where you have a delicious meal in front of a cosy fire. After which you take it in turns to read poetry to each other, followed by thirty minutes of 'Animal Crossing' in the games room.</p>
<p>At last the other Hogger students start returning from their lessons to Hoggerton (this is what you are calling this collection of Hogger Holes) and one of the shouts out to you as they go past: &quot;Dinner time Arthur, Kensley - in the Great Hall!&quot;</p><p></p>

The first feast</h2>
<p>Everyone on Hedgehog table is very pleased to have you in their house, and smiles at you as you take your seat. 
</p><p>&quot;Welcome to Hedgehog House Arthur!&quot; says one boy, who looks like he is in the oldest year. &quot;You dodged a curse by joining Hedgehog House that's for sure. We look after each other and stay out of trouble here I can tell you. Hoggers up!&quot; he suddenly shouts.</p>
<p>The children around the table spontaneously break into the Hedgehog House chant, reciting loudly as they stand up and sit down in together:</p>
<p>&quot;Hoggers up, hoggers down, hoggers hoggers stand your ground.&quot;</p>
<p>You let out a sigh of contentment. This is the place for me alright, you think, proud to call yourself a Hogger.</p>
<p>You are even happier when - the rest of the House Sorting complete - Slumblebore magically conjures up an incredible feast for dinner.</p>
<p>From out of thin air materializes platters of roast beef and boiled sprouts, Yorkshire pudding and mashed turnips, shepherds pie and boiled broccoli, toad in the hole and boiled potatoes, bubble and squeak and boiled carrots, apple crumble with strawberry ice cream, and spotted dick drowning in custard.</p>
<p>&quot;Boiled potatoes, my favourite!&quot; Kensley Potato, a first year who was also chosen for Ravenclaw House, licks her lips.</p>
<p>You and Kensley get chatting over dinner about the different ways of cooking potatoes and before long you are firm friends.</p>
<p>In a rite of initiation all the first years crack open the eggs they received from Percy the Picking Pigeon and guzzle the contents raw.</p>
<p>Then you eat more than you have ever eaten before, enjoying yourself immensely. You wonder if Slumblebore is somehow making the food magically disappear after it enters your stomach, in a similar way to how he made the food appear on the table. But finally you realise you can't cram anything more into your belly, and let out a huge belch.</p>
<p>&quot;Children!&quot; Slumblebore stands, his beard streaked with mashed turnips and the odd boiled potato. He raises his hands for silence. &quot;Children! Now we have eaten our fill it is time for bed. Prefects lead the students to the House towers. And remember: the dungeons are off limits this term. We don't know what's down there, and neither do we want to.&quot;</p>
<p>The children rise to their feet, clutching their distended tummies, and prepare to leave the hall.</p>
<p>You turn to Kensley Potato and say:</p><p></p>

Slumblebore&#39;s office</h2>
<p>Slumblebore's office is easy to find, you just follow the signs pointing the way. When you reach it you see that the door is slightly ajar - and there is a light still on inside. Perhaps Slumblebore has gone to bed and forgotten to turn the light out.
</p><p>You motion Daniel to wait outside and he nods. &quot;Be careful!&quot; he whispers.</p>
<p>You push on the half open door and immediately hear a voice:</p>
<p>&quot;Come in Arthur.&quot; It's Slumblebore - you've been rumbled!</p>
<p>&quot;Don't worry,&quot; Slumblebore says as if reading your thoughts. &quot;I have been waiting for you to come. I wanted to talk with you.&quot;</p>
<p>You walk into Slumblebore's office and look around you. Every inch of space has been used. Leather bound books on bookshelves line the walls. Paintings with ornate golden frames are hung all around, and ancient Hogsnorts headteachers stare down at you, blinking and sniffing. From the ceiling hang silver cages containing magical golden birds, tiny jewelled monkeys no bigger than your thumb and baby dragons curled up and sleeping. On the floor pentagrams have been marked out in yellow chalk and you almost trip over a live weasel dressed in a little red waistcoat that must be a Slumblebore's pet.</p>
<p>Slumblebore himself is sitting behind a massive wooden desk, piled high with manuscripts, scrolls, steaming goblets, plates of watermelon, little bowls of nuts and weasel droppings.</p>
<p>&quot;Care for a raisin?&quot; Slumblebore offers, brushing some weasel droppings onto the floor and proffering you a bowl.</p>
<p>&quot;Err no, thank you,&quot; you reply, not entirely convinced that the bowl is 100% raisins.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur, I'm glad you have come. There is something very serious for us to discuss, which concerns the safety of the entire school. I need your help. But first tell me, how are you settling into the school? Do you feel happy in your new house?&quot;</p><p></p>

Battle rage</h2>
<p>"Die beetles, die!" you cry, running towards the three giant bombardier beetles. 
</p><p>In your battle rage you forget all about magic and your wand, you just want to reach the beetles and grapple them with your bare hands, mano a beetlo.</p>
<p>&quot;Yaaaah!&quot; you cry, closing the distance fast...</p>
<p>...but not fast enough. The three beetles swiftly raise up their bottoms, and shoot out three streams of superheated acid, accompanied by three loud popping sounds.</p>
<p>One stream misses your head by inches, another strikes the wall beside you, the third the floor in front.</p>
<p>&quot;Hahahaha, you missed me, you little...&quot;</p>
<p>But you never get the chance to tell them exactly what type of little things they are because at that moment your foot slips on the pool of acid on the floor and slides out from underneath you. You fly through the air very briefly before slamming into the floor, bumping your head hard enough to knock you out cold.</p><p></p>

Professor Eric Knid</h2>
<p>Professor Eric Knid's classroom is on the ground floor, in a wing of Hogsnorts castle that sticks out a little from the main building. The windows look onto vegetable gardens on one side and some overgrown brambles on the other.
</p><p>You walk into the class with Daniel and sit down.</p>
<p>Professor Knid stands at the front patiently while the children settle. His long arms and legs poke out of his wizard's gown. A strange shimmery cloak dangles from his shoulders. Dressed all in black he looks rather like an overgrown spider.</p>
<p>When there is silence he raises his hands. His odd looking cloak flutters around him while he speaks:</p>
<p>&quot;Today you will learn about the care of magical creatures.</p>
<p>&quot;But before we do that let me take this opportunity to remind you of Slumblebore's warning at the house sorting dinner.&quot; Professor Knid looks out at the class with a piercing gaze and it appears to you that his eyes are focused directly on you.</p>
<p>&quot;No-one must go into the dungeons this term. There is something mysterious and very probably dangerous down there this term, and no-one is allowed to interrupt. Is that clear?&quot;</p>
<p>Nods all round from the class. You exchange raised eyebrows with Daniel. What could be going on down there? And why was Professor Knid staring straight at you?</p>
<p>&quot;Right!&quot; Knid claps his hands.&quot;Can anyone tell me the most common type of magical creature?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Basilisks?&quot; shouts out one boy.</p>
<p>&quot;Boggart!&quot; shouts a girl at the back.</p>
<p>&quot;Banshee!&quot; shouts someone else.</p>
<p>&quot;These are all good answers. But not correct. The most common type of magical creature is the insect, or, more generally: the arthropod. Spiders, snails, flies, ants, beetles, woodlice these are all infinitely more common than the boggart. And many of them have been enchanted by a magician or witch at some point in the past making them effectively immortal until trodden on.</p>
<p>&quot;For example, look closely at my cloak children.&quot; Eric Knid walks up and down the class so the children can see better.</p>
<p>You realise that the professor's cloak is not merely shimmering, it is <em>moving</em>. It seems to be made up of lots of tiny moving <em>things</em>. Then you realise what they are and your eyes widen in hideous fascination.</p>
<p>Eric Knid's cloak is made up of thousands upon thousands of flies, each fly grasping the flies next to it with their tiny hairy legs. As they flutter their wings or move their black and iridescent green bodies, the cloak appears to undulate as if in a breeze.</p>
<p>To you and the rest of the class it seems revolting, but Professor Knid is oblivious.</p>
<p>&quot;Until you look closely my cloak is just an ordinary magician's cape. But it is actually made up of thousands of enchanted and specially trained flies. And each one can fly off at my command to do my bidding - to deliver a message perhaps, or sit on someone's dinner, or to distract a powerful wizard in the act of casting a spell.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes the insect world is a vast and overlooked wonder and in this lesson I am going to teach you about a tiny portion of it.</p>
<p>&quot;But before we learn any magic, does anyone doubt me that the arthropods - the insects - are the true marvels of the animal world?&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Knid looks round expectantly, his eyebrows raised.</p><p></p>

Woodlouse warfare</h2>
<p>"Somnolencia salchicha sabrosa," you cry, brandishing your wand fiercely.
</p><p>A surge of magical power flows through your body, down your arm and out through the wand. A shower of golden sparks races down the corridor raining down onto the three beetles.</p>
<p>Each beetle glows gold for an instant before slowly rolling onto their side and then their backs, six legs waggling gently in the air.</p>
<p>&quot;You didn't kill them did you?&quot; asks Daniel.</p>
<p>&quot;No - how could I? Such magnificent beasts. That was a sleeping spell. Look you can see their legs are still moving.&quot;</p>
<p>They must be dreaming some pleasant beetle dream, perhaps of cantering through a leafy carboniferous glade, as their legs make little wiggles in the air.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's get past them before they wake up.&quot;</p>
<p>You and Daniel step over the sleeping beetles, being careful not to tread on their trailing antennae.</p>
<p>You descend a spiral staircase now and the air is getting dank and stale. It can't be long before you arrive in the dungeon.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the staircase it is pitch black.</p>
<p>You raise your wand and the tip emits a faint golden light, just enough to see by.</p>
<p>You almost wish you hadn't.</p>
<p>Revealed by the dim light of your wand you can see the floor and the walls are completely covered in woodlice. Millions upon millions of them cling to the damp stone slabs that make up the corridor. Millions more cover the flagstones, waving their little antennae. Others have curled up into balls and are rolling around irresponsibly.</p>
<p>Do woodlice even have eyes? You don't know but when you turned on your light they all seemed to turn and look at you.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur, what should we do? There are so many of them!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't move a muscle Daniel&quot; you say in reply. &quot;I have an idea.&quot;</p><p></p>

Night time explorations</h2>
<p>Making sure no-one is following you, you and Daniel tip-toe into the dark night-time passageways of the school.
</p><p>It is pitch black outside but the corridors are lit by enchanted glow globes that give off a golden light.</p>
<p>After a while it is totally silent - everyone else in their house towers and sleeping. The only noise you can hear is the padding of your feet on the flagstones, and the occasional screech of a barn owl from an open window.</p><p></p>

Mirror mirror on the walls</h2>
<p>You and Snako decide to investigate the nearest stone staircase. From the bottom all you can see is that it winds up to some shadowy and little visited part of the school. 
</p><p>At the top of the stone stairs, you encounter a passageway lined with suits of armour. The empty helmets are turned in your direction and twist to follow you and Snako as you walk past. Even though you know they are just ordinary suits of enchanted magical armour the effect is still rather creepy.</p>
<p>At the end of the corridor there is a single door which swings open on silent hinges at your touch.</p>
<p>The room inside is small, dark and bare - but not quite empty.</p>
<p>Next to one wall there is a mirror, with the words above it 'Look at me if you dare, you will see your soul laid bare'.</p>
<p>Opposite, against another wall there's <em>another</em> mirror. Above this one it says 'Stare at me and you will see, what you want to come to be.'</p>
<p>Snako relaxes. &quot;I know what these are! They're mirrors of desire. They show you what you most want in your whole life, maybe even something you didn't even realise. My mother's got one of those in the downstairs toilet.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's amazing!&quot; you breathe, and step up in front of one of the mirrors nervously.</p>
<p>You look at your reflection in the mirror and see...</p>
<p>...a taller, more handsome version of yourself. Your chest is pinned with many shiny medals and on your shoulders are an enormous pair of golden tasselled epaullettes. You are wearing an expensive pair of sunglasses and you can just make out a huge crowd of people behind you who seem to be cheering for you. Your reflection grins at you and you are momentarily blinded. Every tooth is capped in pure gold.</p>
<p>&quot;Wow look at me, I look like some kind of super cool dictator!&quot;</p>
<p>Then you catch the reflection of the mirror behind you in the mirror in front of you - the reflection of the reflection.</p>
<p>In <em>that</em> reflection you are quietly reading a book sitting on a comfortable leather chair, calmly stroking a handsome white cat.</p>
<p>&quot;That's funny,&quot; you say. &quot;The reflection of my reflection in the mirror behind me doesn't look so cool at all...&quot;</p>
<p>Then it dawns on you.</p>
<p>That gold medal champion version of yourself doesn't <em>want</em> all that power and attention. He's bored of it all - <em>I</em> would be bored of it all. What you are seeing is the dictator version of you's most earnest desire - which is for a quiet life, reading a book, stroking a cat.</p>
<p>You angle your head to catch more reflections of reflections and see the images of yourself curve away into infinity.</p>
<p>With each reflection's reflection the cool version of yourself is just that little bit less cool and the quiet version of yourself becomes a little bit less quiet. Far into the depths of the mirrors you can just make out an Arthur just like yourself, waving back at you.</p>
<p>You shake your head, confused, and tell Snako what you saw.</p>
<p>&quot;That's it!&quot; he says. &quot;Don't you see? The person you really want to be, when you get right down to it, is yourself.&quot;</p><p></p>

The dungeon door</h2>
<p>You enter the passageway sloping downwards and after many twists and turns in the passageway you are hopelessly lost.
</p><p>You notice a little spider running around a corner ahead of you. Curiously it then comes back round the corner, looks at you and waits, then lifts up a spindly leg and points.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur&quot; says Aaron, &quot;I think that spider wants us to follow him.&quot;</p>
<p>With no better idea of where to go you follow the spider as it turns this way then that and are delighted to finally arrive at what must surely be the entrance to the dungeon.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Aaron, we've found it!&quot; you whisper fiercely, giving Aaron an excited whack on the shoulder.</p>
<p>A huge wooden door, banded with silver inlaid iron, stands within a stone archway. Either side of the door two antique sets of armour are positioned upright as if on guard.</p>
<p>The spider you were following scurries through the keyhole of the door and disappears. You wonder where he is off to.</p>
<p>Above the door there is a sign written in some archaic font, which reads: &quot;DUNGEON&quot;.</p>
<p>You try the doorknob but it doesn't budge.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a magical enchantment of locking on the door remember!&quot; says Aaron. &quot;We will need to cast a counter spell if we are to get through.&quot;</p>
<p>As you lift up your wand, you rack your brains to try to think of a spell that might work.</p><p></p>

The prophecy</h2>
<p>"Yes there is something I need to talk to you about Arthur, something very important," says Slumblebore. 
</p><p>&quot;Ever since the end of the last school term I have sensed an evil presence in the school. An evil presence that is growing stronger by the day. All that I have been able to determine is that it is coming from the school dungeons. But <em>what</em> it is and <em>where</em> exactly it is down there I do not know. Whatever it is, is beyond my power.&quot;</p>
<p>Slumblebore looks at you directly, his bushy eyebrows waggling.</p>
<p>&quot;This is where you come in Arthur. I need you to investigate what is going on in the dungeon. And deal with it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You want me to go to the dungeon!&quot; you ask, amazed. &quot;But you said at the school dinner that the dungeon was forbidden and no children were to go anywhere near! It's not allowed!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes but Arthur don't you see? I can't just go around encouraging all the children to go down into the dungeons. There would be a stampede! And imagine if anything happened to them? Their parents would take Hogsnorts School to court, the fines could be crippling! No far better if you could just handle this quietly. And don't tell anyone that I told you to go down there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I don't know any magic at all, hardly!&quot; you exclaim, &quot;I've only just started magic school!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I agree you should learn one or two spells before you venture down. Pay attention to your teachers! What they teach you could save your life.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But why me sir? Why not ask one of the older children to do it? Why don't <em>you</em> do it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There is one more thing I haven't told you Arthur. In the summer holidays I discovered an ancient prophecy concerning the school. It was written on a scroll that was so old that as soon as I touched it it turned to dust. It said:</p>
<div class="text-poem">
<p>'<em>When darkness falls across your school.
And evil threatens to rise and rule,<br>
When monsters lurk around school ground.
The boy called Arthur must be found.</em>'</p>
</div>
<p>&quot;Your coming has been foretold. If the prophecy is correct, only you can save us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And if you do this thing Arthur,&quot; Slumblebore adds, &quot;I will personally award one million points for Hedgehog House.&quot;</p><p></p>

Professor Eric Knid</h2>
<p>Professor Eric Knid's classroom is on the ground floor, in a wing of Hogsnorts castle that sticks out a little from the main building. The windows look onto vegetable gardens on one side and some overgrown brambles on the other.
</p><p>You walk into the class with Kensley and sit down. For this lesson Hedgehog House first years have combined with Snakefang House first years. Snako Malboy - a first year Fanger - sits down on your other side and sneers at you unpleasantly.</p>
<p>Professor Knid stands at the front patiently while the children settle. His long arms and legs poke out of his wizard's gown. A strange shimmery cloak dangles from his shoulders. Dressed all in black he looks rather like an overgrown spider.</p>
<p>When there is silence he raises his hands. His odd looking cloak flutters around him while he speaks:</p>
<p>&quot;Today you will learn about the care of magical creatures.</p>
<p>&quot;But before we do that let me take this opportunity to remind you of Slumblebore's warning at the house sorting dinner.&quot; Professor Knid looks out at the class with a piercing gaze and it appears to you that his eyes are focused directly on you.</p>
<p>&quot;No-one must go into the dungeons this term. There is something mysterious and very probably dangerous down there this term, and no-one is allowed to interrupt. Is that clear?&quot;</p>
<p>Nods all round from the class. You exchange raised eyebrows with Kensley. What could be going on down there? And why was Professor Knid staring straight at you?</p>
<p>&quot;Right!&quot; Knid claps his hands.&quot;Can anyone tell me the most common type of magical creature?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Boggles?&quot; shouts out one boy.</p>
<p>&quot;Mere-cats!&quot; shouts a girl at the back.</p>
<p>&quot;Wyrms!&quot; shouts someone else.</p>
<p>&quot;These are all good answers. But not correct, although that last one was a good try. The most common type of magical creature is the insect, or, more generally: the arthropod. Spiders, snails, flies, ants, beetles, woodlice, these are all infinitely more common than the Boggle. And many of them have been enchanted by a magician or witch at some point in the past making them effectively immortal until trodden on.</p>
<p>&quot;For example, look closely at my cloak children.&quot; Eric Knid walks up and down the class so the children can see better.</p>
<p>You realise that the professor's cloak is not merely shimmering, it is <em>moving</em>. It seems to be made up of lots of tiny moving <em>things</em>. Then you realise what they are and your eyes widen in hideous fascination.</p>
<p>Eric Knid's cloak is made up of thousands upon thousands of flies, each fly grasping the flies next to it with their tiny hairy legs. As they flutter their wings or move their black and iridescent green bodies, the cloak appears to undulate as if in a breeze.</p>
<p>To you and the rest of the class it seems revolting, but Professor Knid is oblivious.</p>
<p>&quot;Until you look closely my cloak is just an ordinary magician's cape. But it is actually made up of thousands of enchanted and specially trained flies. And each one can fly off at my command to do my bidding - to deliver a message perhaps, or sit on someone's dinner and do a little poo, or - distract a powerful wizard in the act of casting a spell.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes the insect world is a vast and overlooked wonder and in this lesson I am going to teach you about a tiny portion of it.</p>
<p>&quot;But before we learn any magic, does anyone doubt me that the arthropods - the insects - are the true marvels of the animal world?&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Knid looks round expectantly, his eyebrows raised.</p><p></p>

The great Azog</h2>
<p>Perched on the shoulder of Professor Knid you see an average sized spider gazing at you thoughtfully through his compound eyes. 
</p><p>&quot;But, but... he's just a little spider!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Have some respect!&quot; snaps the Prof. &quot;The Great Azog is of average size for a spider.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Size isn't everything, young Arthur,&quot; says King Azog the spider on the Prof's shoulder. &quot;As you yourself - a first year - well know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But Oh Great Azog,&quot; you ask &quot;What's so special about me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your wand shows that you are special Arthur. The core of your wand has a strand of silk from my bottom. Do you know how many other wands contain my silk? None whatsoever. Yours is the only one. You and the wand were made for each other.</p>
<p>&quot;You and your wand therefore have an unmatched power over all spiders in the world, as I do. But with your wand you are also bonded to me. Our fates are entwined, threaded together. Together we could achieve anything.</p>
<p>&quot;That's why I brought you here: to join me.</p>
<p>&quot;You didn't bring me here!&quot; you protest. &quot;I came here by myself, I <em>chose</em> to come here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You may think you did but every step of the way I was guiding your steps, bringing you closer.</p>
<p>&quot;Who guided you to the disabled toilet in Leeds Railway station, which led you to Hogsnorts? I was the spider that showed you the way.</p>
<p>&quot;Who gave you the courage to face Percy the Picking Pigeon by biting you on the bum?&quot; I was that spider.</p>
<p>&quot;Who showed you the way to the dungeon door? I was that spider too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But what do you want from me?&quot; you implore. &quot;You say I should join you but what are you asking me to do?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The time will soon come&quot; says the Great Azog &quot;For you to make your choice. This time one that really matters. But first <em>I</em> have a decision to make.&quot;</p>
<p>With that the Great Spider King of average size, who had been talking to you from the shoulder of Professor Knid all this time, takes a few quick steps sideways over to the Professor's neck and, without warning, bites down with his fangs.</p>
<p>Instantly Professor Knid collapses to a heap on the dungeon floor and starts snoring.</p><p></p>

Knid&#39;s insects</h2>
<p>You raise your hand and ask "Please sir. Aren't lions better than insects? They're much bigger and stronger."
</p><p>&quot;Spoken like a true Lionpaw student! Lions! Pshaw. But Lionpaws are not known for their intelligence. No boy lions are <em>not</em> better than insects.</p>
<p>&quot;Firstly: lions can't fly but insects can. Insects have been flying for over 350 million years! And we are always so impressed by the birds. Look at me, look at my feathers, I'm a bird! But insects have been flying for twice as long as birds - birds only evolved 150 million years ago. Pathetic.</p>
<p>&quot;Secondly: a lion may look strong but even an ant is stronger. An ant can carry up to fifty times its own body weight. A lion would struggle to give another lion a piggy back. An ant is more than fifty times stronger than a lion!</p>
<p>&quot;Thirdly: how many lions are there in the world? Not many I can tell you. Or how many mammals even? So all the lions, humans, cows, horses, mice and dogs put together?</p>
<p>Mammals make up only 0.4% of all animal species.</p>
<p>Insects species make up 70% of all animal species, and if we include all arthropods that's over 80%. That means for every one mammal species (like a lion) there are <em>170 insect species</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;No, it is clear to me, as it should now be clear to you, that lions are pitiful, almost inconsequential creatures compared to insects and arthropods.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But sir,&quot; interrupts Aaron, &quot;insects <em>are</em> a bit disgusting...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh the prejudice! They may also find you disgusting young man but does that make you so? There will come a day - and maybe sooner than you think - when everyone will appreciate the beauty of an insect, when people don't shudder when I brush past them with my cloak. Yes you will appreciate those 'disgusting' insects soon enough my boy.&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Jape paused and pinched the bridge of his nose with two fingers. &quot;Class dismissed. Your homework is to write an essay with the title 'What I love most about insects and arthropods'. Two thousand words minimum.&quot;</p><p></p>

The dark web</h2>
<p>You and Aaron start pushing at the spider web with your hands.
</p><p>It is amazingly strong and also <em>sticky</em>. When you push a strand it becomes harder and harder to unstick your hands.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur&quot;, cries Aaron, &quot;I'm stuck!&quot;</p>
<p>You turn to the side and see that somehow Aaron has got himself totally tangled up in the web - he is hanging upside down with spider webs curled round his ankles and his hair brushing the floor.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't worry Aaron, I'll get you out!&quot; you reply but as you try to move over towards Aaron you feel thick ropes of spider web curl around your legs and lift you up into the air. In an instant you are as helpless as Aaron.</p>
<p>You feel your panic rising as you struggle. Who is going to help you now? No-one even knows that you are here except perhaps Slumblebore.</p>
<p>&quot;Aaargh! Look Arthur - spiders! Millions of spiders!&quot;</p>
<p>Aaron is right. Crawling out of the cracks of the walls, floor and ceiling is a host of spiders. They scurry along the webs heading for you and Aaron. In a sudden insight you realise that these spiders have made the webs themselves, working as a one enormous team to add strand after strand of spider silk until they had created these thick cobweb ropes. So many spiders working as one! What could they not achieve together?</p>
<p>Then all thoughts flee from your mind as the wave of spiders reach you. They stop inches away.</p>
<p>One lone spider - no bigger than the rest - scuttles out of the pack, delicately steps onto your robes then up to your neck. You see a flash of tiny fangs then you fade into unconsciousness.</p><p></p>

Beetle battle</h2>
<p>You find yourself face to face with a trio of bombardier beetles, who seem to be guarding the way. 
</p><p>&quot;Look how big they are!&quot; says Snako. &quot;I bet they are not friendly.&quot;</p>
<p>One of them makes an angry chittering sound. Even though you don't speak beetle you are pretty sure this beetle doesn't like you.</p>
<p>The three beetles turn around in the corridor to face away from you.</p>
<p>&quot;Look they're running away, the cowards!&quot; shouts Snako letting out a crazy half-laugh.</p>
<p>Suddenly there is a loud popping sound and a steam of superheated liquid shoots out of the beetles' bottoms.</p>
<p>&quot;Duck!&quot; you cry, and you and Snako throw yourself to one side. The liquid misses you by inches. The stone flagstone bubbles and fizzes where the liquid struck it.</p>
<p>You both pick yourself up off the floor and scramble back round the corner for safety.</p>
<p>&quot;That was too close,&quot; you say. &quot;We need to find a way to destroy those beasts, or at least get them out of the way.&quot;</p>
<p>You think hard, there must be a spell that you can use. Some spell that kills them or puts them out of action for a while.</p>

<p>Opposite, against another wall there's <em>another</em> mirror. Above this one it says 'Stare at me and you will see, what you want to come to be.'</p>
<p>Kensley relaxes. &quot;I know what these are! They're mirrors of desire. They show you what you most want in your whole life, maybe even something you didn't even realise. My granny's got one in the bathroom.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not sure I want to look...&quot; you say, but your curiosity compels you to step up in front of one of the mirrors.</p>
<p>You look at your reflection in the mirror and see...</p>
<p>...a beaming, chubbier and slightly older version of yourself. You are wearing a lovely pair of green wellington boots and a fetching brown tweed waistcoat. In one hand you hold a bunch of the largest carrots you have ever seen and in the other a trophy on which you can just make out the words 'Gardener of the Year'.</p>
<p>&quot;Kensley look, I'm chief gardener. And look at the size of those carrots!&quot;</p>
<p>Then you catch the reflection of the mirror behind you in the mirror in front of you - the reflection of the reflection.</p>
<p>In <em>that</em> reflection you are calmly sitting at a table, wearing worn out clothes, and pushing seeds one at a time into little pots filled with compost.</p>
<p>&quot;That's funny,&quot; you say. &quot;The reflection of my reflection in the mirror behind me doesn't look like an award winning gardener at all...&quot;</p>
<p>Then it dawns on you.</p>
<p>That Gardner of the Year version of yourself doesn't <em>want</em> all that fame and attention. He's tired of it - <em>I</em> would be tired of it. What you are seeing is the top gardener version of you's most earnest desire - which is for a quiet life, doing what he really loves: growing vegetables.</p>
<p>You angle your head to catch more reflections of reflections and see the images of yourself curve away into infinity.</p>
<p>With each reflection's reflection the chief gardener version of yourself is just that little bit less successful, with slightly shorter carrots, and the quiet version of yourself becomes a little bit less shabby. Far into the depths of the mirrors you can just make out an Arthur just like yourself, waving back at you.</p>
<p>You shake your head, confused, and tell Kensley what you saw.</p>
<p>&quot;That's it!&quot; she says. &quot;That must be it! The person you really want to be, when you get right down to it, is yourself.&quot;</p><p></p>

A speedy recovery</h2>
<p>With a groan you open your eyes.
</p><p>Looking around you you appear to be in the Hogsnorts School hospital. You see Aaron lying next to you on an identical bed, also groaning. Various medical instruments hang on the walls: stethoscopes, ear trumpets, syringes, magnifying glasses.</p>
<p>How did I get here? you wonder. Then it comes back to you and you shudder: the dungeon.</p>
<p>Something bad is definitely going on down there. Now even more than before you realise that you <em>have</em> to stop it, whatever it is. It is up to you - and for next time you know at least one choice that you should not make again...</p>
<p>&quot;Hello Arther, Aaron. I see you have returned to the conscious realm.&quot; Madame Blavatsky, the Professor of Defence Against Dark Magic walks into the room.</p>
<p>&quot;Wssrrflbittit?&quot; you mumble.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes you had quite a shock back there I'm sure. When Slumblebore found you, you were both completely unconscious. But don't worry you will make a full recovery - the antiodarkotics I gave you will flush all the bad magic out shortly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you&quot; you manage to say.</p>
<p>&quot;But the most important thing is that you get some rest. I'm going to cast a sleeping spell on you now, timed so that you will wake up tomorrow morning at 7am. When you are sleeping soundly I will teleport you to your own en-suite bedrooms in your House Tower.&quot;</p>
<p>As she chants the magic words &quot;<em>somnolencia salchicha sabrosa</em>&quot; you try to speak but you can't stop yourself drifting away.</p>

Epilogue</h2>
<p>"Good morning Brian Banana!"
</p><p>&quot;Good morning Arthur!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good morning Kensley Potato. Kensley! Kensley? Now where has she disappeared to...?</p>
<p>&quot;Good morning Rebecca Radishbottom!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good morning Arthur!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good morning Azog the Great!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good morning young Arthur!&quot;</p>
<p>You sit down on the bench next to Azog, outside the insects' Hogger Hole, and enjoy the feeling of the mid morning sun on your face.</p>
<p>It's been a year since you led the insect horde out of the school dungeon to their new abode, a year of hard work, a year of peace.</p>
<p>You still remember those first days as if it were yesterday. Kensley was delighted to find you alive and well and even more delighted when you gave her back the ring she dropped.</p>
<p>The other Hedgehog House students were initially uneasy about an insect army moving in next door, but you passionately defended them, explaining that this was the only way to end generations of suffering - of insect bites and wasp stings versus crushed ants and swatted flies.</p>
<p>Acceptance from the Hoggers only came in full measure when the insects started helping out with the vegetable gardens, keeping the plants free from pests and nourishing them with their own tiny droppings. If a snail gave into temptation and nibbled on a lettuce leaf he was soon restrained by his fellow creatures.</p>
<p>The Hoggers were thrilled and the arthropods were here to stay.</p>
<p>&quot;How are the little ones Azog?&quot; you ask kindly.</p>
<p>&quot;Coming along very well, thank you Arthur. There's a new batch of ten thousand ants hatching this week, and fifteen thousand fly larvae will be pupating shortly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's wonderful news,&quot; you reply. You are particularly happy about the flies as they are the eyes and ears of the colony, buzzing off to investigate the doings of neighbouring shires.</p>
<p>&quot;And how about your carrots Arthur?&quot;</p>
<p>You reach into your basket and proudly pull out a bunch of carrots of monstrous size, each as big as a squidditch stick.</p>
<p>&quot;I will win first prize at the fair for sure!&quot; you reply. &quot;I couldn't be happier - and I couldn't do it without the insects! Their manure is first rate.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The droppings of the arthropods - not to be sniffed at. But it's the least we can do to say thank you. From the first moment I saw you I knew you were the special one. Thank you Arthur. Thank you for leading us here. We have peace in our time because of you, and it is small recompense to provide you with the ordure of the arthropods.&quot;</p>
<p>CONGRATULATIONS, YOU HAVE ACHIEVED THE LIVING IN HARMONY WITH INSECTS ENDING</p><p></p>

School hero</h2>
<p>It takes you just an instant to decide. 
</p><p>No way are you going to share power with anyone else, especially not a disgusting little spider! You are going to fight back and destroy the insects, starting with Azog.</p>
<p>Whipping out your wand you cry &quot;Fiel fresa fusila fuego!&quot; and flames shoot out, bathing the dungeon in flickering light.</p>
<p>Azog is too nimble to be caught so easily though and leaps out of the way.</p>
<p>&quot;You will regret your choice Arthur,&quot; screams the spider king in outrage. &quot;Insects, attack!&quot;</p>
<p>From out of cracks in the walls, ceiling and floor crawl millions upon millions of arthropods: beetles, woodlice, ants, millipedes, earwigs, spiders in a great stream heading straight for you.</p>
<p>This time you don't hesitate. If you stay you will be surrounded and overwhelmed. You turn and run.</p>
<p>Your heart pounding, you run back out of the dungeon up towards the school. You have a plan.</p>
<p>When you reach the enchanted door that leads down into the dungeon you dash through and slam it shut. You can hear the enchanted locking mechanism clicking shut.</p>
<p>There's only one way for the insects to get past the door now - through the keyhole. You turn and wait, your wand at the ready.</p>
<p>As soon as you see the first hairy little leg poking out of the keyhole you use your wand as a flamethrower shouting &quot;fiel fresa fusila fuego&quot; again and again until your voice is hoarse.</p>
<p>The air is full of the harsh high pitched cries of dying arthropods and the sizzle of roasting chitin. But still the insects come, propelled onwards by the Great Azog's iron will.</p>
<p>You are getting tired now, your arm is sore from being held up so long and you can feel your reserves of magical energy running out. You cannot hold out much longer.</p>
<p>For a moment the magical fire from your wand flickers and dies.</p>
<p>Then three things happen simultaneously:</p>
<p>One: Azog, sensing his chance, launches himself through the keyhole aiming straight for your face.</p>
<p>Two: Snako and Slumblebore run round the corner to see you battling the numberless insect foe on your own.</p>
<p>Three: your faltering spell was a trick. You have enough magical power for one last spell...</p>
<p>&quot;Fiel fresa fusila fuego!&quot; you scream pointing your wand at Azog as he flies through the air towards you.</p>
<p>Then...</p>
<p>Azog, leaping through the air fangs at the ready, is unable to change direction. Just as your wand arm comes <em>up</em> he reaches the tip of the wand, only to be blasted backwards by a concentrated jet of magical fire. Even the great Azog cannot withstand an attack at such close range. He hits the wall next to the dungeon door, his legs still on fire and body a smoking ruin.</p>
<p>The last words of Azog the Great are &quot;Arthur... you have roasted me...&quot;. Then a final puff and Azog is no more.</p>
<p>With Azog a gonner the rest of the arthropod hordes lose all cohesion. When Slumblebore cautiously opens the door to the dungeon they are fleeing in all directions, and will trouble the school no more. Slumblebore lets off a few more blasts of fire to encourage them on their way.</p>
<p>&quot;You did it Arthur!&quot; cries Snako. &quot;You saved the school - the insects have gone!&quot;</p>
<p>You stand still and listen carefully. Snako is right. You cannot sense the insects any longer. The dungeons have been cleansed.</p>
<p>&quot;Well done indeed Arthur,&quot; and Slumblebore, turning back to you. &quot;I had a feeling that you were the special one. Without you I fear we would have been overrun by arthropods by now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was Eric Knid,&quot; you say to Slumblebore. &quot;It was Professor Knid who summoned the insect army, with Azog the spider king. He is down in the dungeon now unconscious. Azog bit him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Eric did you say? Well I'm not surprised. He always struck me as a bit of an odd fish. Nevermind we will pick him up in the morning and I shall give him an official reprimand. And if he does it again I will have no choice but to put him on a performance improvement plan.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But you Arthur, what else can I give <em>you</em> but my most heartfelt thanks.&quot; You can't suppress a broad grin. You did it! You defeated Azog and his insect army single handed!</p>
<p>Slumbelbore continues: &quot;You truly are a hero Arthur, a hero of Hogsnorts School.&quot;</p><p></p>

Jape&#39;s spell</h2>
<p>Along with most of the other children you keep your hands down.
</p><p>&quot;You don't want to hear my jokes? Well I never!&quot; Professor Jape looks genuinely hurt for a moment, but quickly recovers his composure.</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps you will be laughing on the other side of your face by the end of this lesson.&quot; Jape gives another high pitched giggle and you all shift on your seats uneasily.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe,&quot; he continues, &quot;you will enjoy this one. I need a volunteer!&quot;</p>
<p>No one volunteers so Jape scans the classroom. He points at Aaron.</p>
<p>&quot;You! Come forward.&quot;</p>
<p>Aaron shuffles forward to the front of the class.</p>
<p>Without any warning Professor Jape whips out his wand, points it at Aaron and yells: &quot;<em>Vamos varita vencer vistosamente!</em>&quot;</p>
<p>A golden light extrudes out of the tip of Jape's wand. The light looks like a solid sparkly golden beam and extends for one metre then stops. Jape swings his wand around and you realise that he has created a magical golden light sword! As the golden beam swipes through the air it makes satisfying swishing zoom noises.</p>
<p>&quot;En guard!&quot; snaps Jape to Aaron with a gleam in his eye before suddenly launching into a frenzied attack, swiping left and right with his light sword. In a flash he has covered the 5 metres to Aaron and he holds the light sword directly at Aaron's throat.</p>
<p>&quot;Now you will die.&quot; Jape says simply.</p>
<p>There is dead silence in the class. Everyone is holding their breath.</p>
<p>Then, almost in exact unison, everyone screams and runs out of the door, except Aaron who is rooted to the spot in fear, and you because you don't want to abandon your friend.</p>
<p>Professor Jape lowers the light sword and gives a high pitched giggle.</p>
<p>&quot;I were just joking, didn't you know that?&quot; he said to the fleeing children. &quot;It were just a joke!&quot; he shouted louder at their fleeing backs.</p>
<p>Professor Jape sighs and says to you and Aaron: &quot;They can't take a joke, can they? Well lessons over now I suppose. But remember: <em>Vamos varita vencer vistosamente</em> that's a good one that is!&quot;</p>
<p>You and Aaron nod and swallow, and without saying another word, flee out of the classroom.</p><p></p>

<h1>Headmaster Professor Slumblebore's hints on exploring Hogsnorts and investigating the dungeons</h1>
<p>Quillus startus. Hello? Hello? Is this working? I'm recording my voice onto paper using magic: with my own spell in fact, which I'm rather proud of.</p>
<p>Arthur, I am writing this message to help you get through the school and find your way to the dungeons where there is something rather strange going on. You need to get to the bottom of it. And if there is any foul play going on down there, you must clean it up.</p>
<p>Your professors will teach you some essential spells to help you overcome the challenges you will face. But you will have to talk to them carefully to make sure that they don't get distracted in their lessons.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Professor Comicus Jape is an excellent teacher of offensive magic but he can get distracted by telling jokes. If you ignore his jokes, he can teach you a very useful spell to <strong>transform your wand into a magic sword</strong> that can cut through anything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Professor Madam Blavatksy knows an extremely useful <strong>sleeping spell</strong>. However you must be patient and humble. If you show her that you do not pretend to know all the answers, she will help you and teach you her sleeping enchantment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Professor Eric Knid is a rather peculiar fellow to tell you the truth. But he does know a marvellous <strong>flamethrower spell</strong>, which I myself have used to roast marshmallows. Just make sure you don't get him started on his favourite topic: why insects are so amazing, otherwise he will forget all about teaching you magic.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find the dungeon by sneaking off into the school at night time after dinner. Or by creeping off into the school after your lessons, or after you bunk off for the day.</p>
<p>To open the door to the dungeon you will need the magic password. Come and see me in my office at night time and I will tell you what it is.</p>
<p>Finally, do not be afraid!</p>
<p>Whatever choices you make you will never be in a situation you cannot get out of. And you will not get into trouble whatever you do. I am relying on you to save the school and you may need to break a few rules.</p>
<p>That is all I wanted to tell you Arthur - good luck! Quill stop. Magicus stoppus. Stop writing. Just stop it! Why isn't this thing stopping? Ah I remember now: quillus stoppus.</p>
