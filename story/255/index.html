Professor Eric Knid Explains<br>
<span class="text-size-x2">ðŸ”’</span></h1>
<div>
<p>A voice, strong and commanding, emerges from the darkness. "You? The saviour, a mere stripling first year? Impossible!"  
</p><p>Another voice, high pitched and chittery, answers him. &quot;Yes Eric, this is him. He is the wand holder.&quot;</p>
<p>As your eyes adjust to the gloom, you can make out a figure standing in the centre of the room. A wizard - and someone you recognise.</p>
<p>&quot;Professor Knid! But what...?&quot; you exclaim.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes Professor Eric Knid at your service! Or perhaps I should say that you will be at my service... Arthur isn't it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes my name's Arthur. Arthur Otley.&quot; A sensation of fear congeals in your throat so strong that you can barely speak. &quot;What do you mean? And who were you talking to just now?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All in good time, Arthur...&quot; with an unexpectedly swift movement Professor Knid draws his wand and shoots a spell of locking at the iron gate which... swings shut and then hits some invisible object and swings open again. There is a curious noise like a muffled cry, and then finally the clangs shut.</p>
<p>But there is no time to worry about the curious muffled cry - you are trapped.</p>
<p>&quot;What are you going to do?&quot; you exclaim in a fearful high pitched squeak.</p>
<p>Eric Knid smiled. Even in the dark you can see the mad gleam in his eye: &quot;Revolution!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Explain why Eric.&quot; That chittering voice again, appearing out of nowhere.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes - why. Why?&quot; Professor Knid takes a deep breath. &quot;Ever since I was a young boy Arthur I have felt an affinity with insects, spiders, crabs. With the Arthropods. A dog will bite you, not so an earwig! A lion may eat you, not so a woodlouse! A human may betray you, a spider will not.</p>
<p>&quot;My faithful friends growing up were slugs, ants, flies and beetles. But my friends were mercilessly crushed, poisoned, and swatted by humans.</p>
<p>&quot;The final straw? Slumblebore sat on a spider - and laughed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I couldn't bear it. I sought out the Great Spider King Azog himself. What joy when I found him in the forbidden bushes and entered his service. Together we have been gathering supporters here in this dungeon, insects and spiders in their millions. For revenge. For a revolution. To take over the school!</p>
<p>&quot;No longer will it just be Lionpaw House, Ravenwing House, Snakefang House, and Hedgehog House! We will have a new house mightier than all of them. The Order of the Arthropods! And I will be headmaster.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But why me?&quot; fear chills you. &quot;I'm just a first year, I don't want any trouble.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are the only one who can stop us Arthur,&quot; says the mysterious high pitched voice. &quot;But with you on our side we will be invincible!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who is that?&quot; you cry.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the Great Spider King Azog himself. And you are honoured to stand in his presence.&quot; Professor Knid explains.</p>
<p>&quot;Where?&quot; You can't see anyone other than the Professor.</p>
<p>&quot;Here!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where, I can't see!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right here, look! Closer!&quot;</p><p></p>
