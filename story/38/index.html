A visit to Spellwitches<br>
<span class="text-size-x2">ðŸ‘—</span></h1>
<div>
<p>If you are going to be a wizard you need to look the part. You decide to visit Spellwitches to get your robes first.
</p><p>The shop has large storefront windows. Inside the windows manikins have been arranged wearing black witch and wizard robes. The manikins are in a variety of action poses, such as just about to cast a spell, or frozen running away from a dragon.</p>
<p>But they have clearly been magically enchanted because every now and again one of the manikins will change their position to something else, moving smoothly with astonishing realism. You look at the manikins carefully - they really are amazingly life-like, even down to the expressions of surprise on their faces.</p>
<p>You and your mum make a little bell dingle as you push open the door.</p>
<p>In front of you are racks and racks of wizard robes, all black. Above some racks a sign says 'small', above others it says 'medium', and others 'large'.</p>
<p>Shelves cover the walls and the shelves are covered in pointy black hats.</p>
<p>&quot;May I help you at all?&quot;</p>
<p>You and your mum both jump - a witch with a totally green face leaps out from behind a rack of black robes just in front of you.</p>
<p>&quot;Just browsing are you?&quot;</p>
<p>You jump again as another witch, looking identical to the first, pops out from a rack of clothes behind you.</p>
<p>&quot;Aargh!&quot; you exclaim. You take a breath and calm yourself and clear your throat.</p>
<p>&quot;Robes?&quot; you squeak &quot;For Hogsnorts?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are in the right place my little dear&quot; said green witch number 1. &quot;Let's see how you measure up!&quot;</p>
<p>The two witches take you to a side room where a magic tape measure is already taking the measurements of a pale looking boy about your age.</p>
<p>The boy looks at you with an expression that could either be a sneer or a smile, you can't quite be sure.</p>
<p>Do you:</p><p></p>
