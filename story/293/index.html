<p>With a groan you open your eyes.
</p><p>Looking around you you appear to be in the Hogsnorts School hospital. You see Aaron lying next to you on an identical bed, also groaning. Various medical instruments hang on the walls: stethoscopes, ear trumpets, syringes, magnifying glasses.</p>
<p>How did I get here? you wonder. Then it comes back to you and you shudder: the dungeon.</p>
<p>Something bad is definitely going on down there. Now even more than before you realise that you <em>have</em> to stop it, whatever it is. It is up to you - and for next time you know at least one choice that you should not make again...</p>
<p>&quot;Hello Arther, Aaron. I see you have returned to the conscious realm.&quot; Madame Blavatsky, the Professor of Defence Against Dark Magic walks into the room.</p>
<p>&quot;Wssrrflbittit?&quot; you mumble.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes you had quite a shock back there I'm sure. When Slumblebore found you, you were both completely unconscious. But don't worry you will make a full recovery - the antiodarkotics I gave you will flush all the bad magic out shortly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you&quot; you manage to say.</p>
<p>&quot;But the most important thing is that you get some rest. I'm going to cast a sleeping spell on you now, timed so that you will wake up tomorrow morning at 7am. When you are sleeping soundly I will teleport you to your own en-suite bedrooms in your House Tower.&quot;</p>
<p>As she chants the magic words &quot;<em>somnolencia salchicha sabrosa</em>&quot; you try to speak but you can't stop yourself drifting away.</p>
<p>What is in the dungeon? you want to ask. Your lips form the word &quot;Wha...?&quot;...</p><p></p>
