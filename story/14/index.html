<p>You walk over to the family of red haired wizards on the other side of the station.
</p><p>&quot;Excuse me&quot; you ask, &quot;are you wizards?&quot;</p>
<p>The children look a bit shifty and say nothing, while the Dad answers for them: &quot;Wizards? No we're err... on our way to a fancy dress party. Why do you want to know anyway?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm trying to find the train to Hogsnorts but I don't know where it is, and it is almost time for the train to leave!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah I see,&quot; says the mum, &quot;that's the train we want too. Yes we are wizards but we try to keep it quiet, you know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mum!&quot; interrupts one of the red haired children, &quot;now we are definitely going to miss the train!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We're going to miss the train?&quot; you ask. &quot;Does that mean that we can't get to Hogsnorts now?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't worry young man&quot; says the Dad. &quot;Where there's a wizard there's a way, eh? But first we should introduce ourselves. We are the Bleezeley family:</p>
<p>&quot;This is Aaron, who is going to Hogsnorts for the first time this year.&quot; (The shortest red haired boy gives you a small wave.)</p>
<p>&quot;These two are Alex and Robert. They are in year 4&quot; (Alex and Robert nod their heads at you.)</p>
<p>&quot;I'm Mr Bleezeley and this is Mrs Bleezeley.&quot; (Mrs Bleezeley gives you a cheery thumbs up.)</p>
<p>&quot;Hello everyone,&quot; you say. &quot;My name is Arthur Otley and I just discovered I was a wizard a few days ago. I'm a first year. This is my dad and my younger brother Evan&quot; (Your dad and Evan have just walked up.)</p>
<p>&quot;Of course you're a wizard Arthur,&quot; said the mum, &quot;You've got red hair like us! Most people with red hair have at least a bit of magic in them and I can see that you've got more than most!&quot;</p>
<p>You are pleased to hear Mrs Bleezeley say this, but still feel worried about the train.</p>
<p>&quot;But M Bleezeley, Mrs Bleezeley, what about the train? How are we going to get to Hogsnorts?&quot; you ask.</p>
<p>Mr Bleezeley taps his nose conspiratorially. &quot;Follow me.&quot;</p>
<p>You:</p><p></p>
