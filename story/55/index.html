<div class="text-justify">
<p>You unzip and do as your Dad suggests, letting out a sigh as you tinkle in the toilet. You were so sure this was the right place. Evan sighs too and starts playing with the toilet brush 
<p>Curiously, as you do your wee in the toilet you notice that your urine is giving off a faint magical golden glow. Odd you think, as you zip yourself up and press the flush...</p>
<p>...and leap backwards in surprise as the whole toilet and then the wall behind it disappears in a magical swirling spiral, leaving a perfectly round tunnel with steps heading deep down into the darkness. It is just like how the wall opened to get to Hippoto Mews, but this time it must have been activated by the magic sparkles in your wee!</p>
<p>&quot;This is the way!&quot; you shout, &quot;let's go!&quot;</p>
<p>The stairs go down and down for ages, but finally you see a brightly lit tunnel far below. Redoubling your efforts you bound down the remaining steps to find yourself in...</p>
<p>...a tiled white tunnel that looks very much like the sort of tunnels you get in the London underground, except with strange magical sigils forming repeating patterns on the walls and emitting a warm golden light.</p>
<p>You run down the tunnel - it can't be long until the train leaves now! - and arrive at an underground station platform.</p>
<p>You see a tube train filled with children and a platform crowded with parents saying goodbye. You look up at the announcement board and read:</p>
<p>&quot;Hogsnorts: 1 minute&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Look Dad! The Hogsnorts Express is a tube train!&quot; you exclaim. &quot;And we're just in time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Goodbye Arthur,&quot; says your Dad &quot;Good luck in wizard school! Write to us as often as you can. We'll see you in six weeks when it's the holidays.&quot; There is a tear in his eye as he gives you a hug goodbye.</p>
<p>&quot;Bye bye Arthur,&quot; says Evan hugging your middle. &quot;Teach me a magic spell when you come back home.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I will Evan,&quot; you say. &quot;Goodbye and see you in a few weeks.&quot;</p>
<p>You spot the boy from the spellbook shop in one carriage, and in another the boy from the robe shop.</p>
<p>A piercing steam whistle shriek sounds from the front of the train.</p>
<p>&quot;Mind the doors please!&quot; a magically amplified voice calls out. &quot;Mind the closing doors!&quot;</p>
<p>Do you:</p></p>

<p>1. Go into the carriage with the boy from the spellbook shop ~ <strong><a href="/story/61" >Go to number 61</a></strong></p>
<p>2. Enter the carriage with the boy from the robe shop ~ <strong><a href="/story/67" >Go to number 67</a></strong></p>
<p>3. Go into a different another carriage altogether ~ <strong><a href="/story/28" >Go to number 28</a></strong></p>
