Wesley the Weasel<br>
<span class="text-size-x2">üçá</span></h1>
<div>
<p>You reach out a hand to pet the weasel, who allows you to pat him on the head.
</p><p>&quot;Ah, my pet weasel Arthur, do please go ahead and stroke him, by all means. Wesley craves human contact, as long as the human is not from Snakefang house. You see Arthur,&quot; Slumblebore explains as you stroke the weasel, &quot;Wesley was not always a weasel. He was not always called Wesley either. Let me explain.</p>
<p>&quot;Wesley used to be a real boy just like you Arthur. Then one day in an ill-tempered dispute with a Snakefang House student about who had the fastest broomstick, he was transformed by magic into the weasel you see before you. Unfortunately the spell was permanent.&quot;</p>
<p>Wesley listens to all this intently, and he leaps onto Slumblebore's desk, chattering his teeth in rage and frustration.</p>
<p>&quot;As Wesley was an orphan I realised that the kindest thing to do would be to adopt him as my pet. My tailor on Hippotomews specially made his red waistcoat and matching hat. And I decided to give him his new name: Wesley, because Wesley the Weasel has a rather pleasing ring to it, don't you think? His boy name before that was Gary, which would never do. Or possibly it was Barry.</p>
<p>&quot;Ever since then he has lived with me. We get along famously although I must admit that his table manners are not all that they might be - he has an unfortunate habit of defecating in the raisins.&quot;</p>
<p>Wesley hangs his head, shamefacedly.</p>
<p>&quot;But do not let that worry you,&quot; says Slumblebore brightening. &quot;Because every once in a while, I cast a spell to turn all the droppings in the room into raisins. Then they taste virtually identical in any case.</p>
<p>&quot;Why do I tell you all this Arthur? Because I want you to know that for all my students I will always be there for them. I will always be there for you, when you need help the most. Always, Arthur, always. Metaphorically. Just like I was for Barry. Or was it Larry.</p><p></p>
