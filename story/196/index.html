Dinner time<br>
<span class="text-size-x2">üçΩÔ∏è</span></h1>
<div>
<p>Joining a gaggle of other Lionpaw students you head off on the long winding route back to the Hogsnorts Great Hall to get your dinner.
</p><p>You take a seat at the Lionpaw table (after shouldering some snivelling Snakefangs out of the way) and look around amazed.</p>
<p>Tonight Slumblebore has enchanted the ceiling and the walls to look exactly as if the Great Hall had become a giant spaceship exploring the galaxy. Stars whizz by on either side and every now and again you skirt a giant whirling black hole vortex. He has even enchanted the chairs to lean to the side when the spaceship turns a corner. You stare at the stars and nebulae whooshing past with wide eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't forget to eat Arthur!&quot; Aaron reminds you, elbowing you in the side.</p>
<p>You look down to see yet another incredible feast laid out on the table. An entire roast hog with an apple in its mouth. Hundreds of chicken drumsticks covered in a delicious deep fried sauce, Kentucky style. Chips cooked to crispy perfection with overflowing bowls of tomato ketchup and mayonnaise to dip them into. Forests of broccoli, with cooked prawns hanging from the branches. Baked bananas, smothered in condensed milk and peanut butter. Strawberries, each the size of a your fist with amusing faces carved into them and raisins for eyes.</p>
<p>It is all so delicious you can't stop an involuntary slobber which you quickly wipe from your chin with the table cloth.</p>
<p>You cram food into your mouth and gulp it down.</p>
<p>When you are full you have a brief food fight with Snakefang table, pelting them with giant strawberries and chicken drumsticks - they return the attack with profiteroles and bread soaked in gravy. You are particularly pleased to hit Snako Malboy in the eye with a boiled potato.</p>
<p>The fight ends when the space-scape enchantment on the walls and ceiling reveals a full scale alien spaceship attack. You scream and shout with the other students as Slumbledore simulates a spectacular laser battle.</p>
<p>Chairs are leaning crazily as the Dining Hall spaceship takes evasive action. Pretend laser bolts zap chicken drumsticks to ashes. Several Hedgehog House students vomits on the floor, overcome with motion sickness.</p>
<p>It's complete pandemonium, which ends with the total alien defeat, their broken vessels drifting through the void.</p>
<p>&quot;North paw, south paw, we score, Lionpaw!&quot; shouts Aaron at the top of his voice, overcome with excitement, boxing an imaginary foe.</p>
<p>This signals the end of the best dinner you have ever had.</p>
<p>Turning to Aaron you say.</p><p></p>
