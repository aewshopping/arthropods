The great Azog<br>
<span class="text-size-x2">üï∑Ô∏è</span></h1>
<div>
<p>Perched on the shoulder of Professor King you see an average sized spider gazing at you thoughtfully through his compound eyes. 
</p><p>&quot;But, but... he's just a little spider!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Have some respect!&quot; snaps the Prof. &quot;The Great Azog is of average size for a spider.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Size isn't everything, young Arthur,&quot; says King Azog the spider on the Prof's shoulder. &quot;As you yourself - a first year - well know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But Oh Great Azog,&quot; you ask &quot;What's so special about me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your wand shows that you are special Arthur. The core of your wand has a strand of silk from my bottom. Do you know how many other wands contain my silk? None whatsoever. Yours is the only one. You and the wand were made for each other.</p>
<p>&quot;You and your wand therefore have an unmatched power over all spiders in the world, as I do. But with your wand you are also bonded to me. Our fates are entwined, threaded together. Together we could achieve anything.</p>
<p>&quot;That's why I brought you here: to join me.</p>
<p>&quot;You didn't bring me here!&quot; you protest. &quot;I came here by myself, I <em>chose</em> to come here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You may think you did but every step of the way I was guiding your steps, bringing you closer.</p>
<p>&quot;Who guided you to the disabled toilet in Leeds Railway station, which led you to Hogsnorts? I was the spider that showed you the way.</p>
<p>&quot;Who gave you the courage to face Percy the Picking Pigeon by biting you on the bum?&quot; I was that spider.</p>
<p>&quot;Who showed you the way to the dungeon door? I was that spider too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But what do you want from me?&quot; you implore. &quot;You say I should join you but what are you asking me to do?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The time will soon come&quot; says the Great Azog &quot;For you to make your choice. This time one that really matters. But first <em>I</em> have a decision to make.&quot;</p>
<p>With that the Great Spider King of average size, who had been talking to you from the shoulder of Professor King all this time, takes a few quick steps sideways over to the Professor's neck and, without warning, bites down with his fangs.</p>
<p>Instantly Professor Knid collapses to a heap on the dungeon floor and starts snoring.</p><p></p>
