The magical void<br>
<span class="text-size-x2">ðŸŒŒ</span></h1>
<div>
<p>You find yourself in a magical place that exists outside time and outside space.
</p><p>The only way to reach here is by powerful magic. No path can take you here. No decision you make will lead you to this place.</p>
<p>Only the very best wizards can command this level of magical power.</p>
<p>You appear to be floating in a sort of void. If you want to move you only have to <em>think</em> yourself moving. Across this void glimmer infinitely long twists and curtains of shimmering golden sparkles: raw magic.</p>
<p>It is peaceful. You feel relaxed and calm. The troubles of the world do not reach here.</p>
<p>You think yourself over to a golden pillar of glittering magical dust and let it run over your hand. You feel the magic enter your veins and your magical strength increases further.</p>
<p>Now that you have found this place and touched the magic dust you only have to think of the magic number &quot;42&quot; and you will be instantly teleported back here.</p>
<p>Looking around you notice transparent rainbow bubbles floating between the twisting columns of golden dust.</p>
<p>You look closer.</p>
<p>Each bubble is the size of a football. Inside the bubbles you can see figures moving - people. You recognise <em>yourself</em> in the bubbles.</p>
<p>You realise that the bubbles must be windows into your past - and your future. Each bubble is an important moment in your life. As soon as you realise this you also know that all you have to do is reach into a bubble and you will be transported to that time and place.</p>
<p>A feeling of deep happiness settles upon you. You can go to any back - or forwards - to anytime in your life it is your choice.</p>
<p>Or should you <em>double</em> your efforts, try <em>two times as much</em> as you are now, and explore this magical void a little more?</p>
<p>But anytime you want you can come back here, to this shimmering golden magical void, filled with peace - just by thinking the magic number: 42.</p>
<p>Will you reach into a bubble - or linger here a while longer?</p><p></p>
