<p>You raise your hand and ask "Aren't snakes better than insects? They're bigger and cleverer for a start."
</p><p>&quot;Spoken like a true Snakefang student! Snakes! Pshaw. But Snakefangers are not known for their perspicacity, are they? No boy, snakes are <em>not</em> better than insects.</p>
<p>&quot;Firstly: snakes can't fly but insects can. Insects have been flying for over 350 million years! And to think we are always <em>so impressed</em> by the birds. Look at me, look at my feathers, I'm a bird! But insects have been flying for twice as long as birds - birds only evolved 150 million years ago. Pathetic.</p>
<p>&quot;Secondly: a snake's cleverness is nothing compared even to an ant, who - working together - can build homes hundreds of times taller than they are. Skyscrapers! With air-conditioning, nurseries, storage chambers. And what is a snake's home? Just a pile of old logs. Pathetic.</p>
<p>&quot;Thirdly: how many snakes are there in the world? Not many I can tell you. Or how many reptiles even? All the snakes, iguanas, and lizards put together?</p>
<p>Reptiles make up only 0.1% of all animal species.</p>
<p>Insects species make up 70% of all animal species, and if we include all arthropods that's over 80%. That means for every one reptile species (like a snake) there are <em>more than 600 insect species</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;No, it is clear to me, as it should now be clear to you, that snakes are pitiful, almost inconsequential creatures compared to insects and arthropods.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But sir,&quot; interrupts Snako, &quot;insects <em>are</em> disgusting...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh the cheek of it! Who is to say that you are not disgusting young man with your.... goggly eyes and snotty nose? There will come a day - and maybe sooner than you think - when everyone will appreciate the magnificence of an insect, when people don't shudder when I brush past them with my cloak. Yes you will appreciate those 'disgusting' insects soon enough my boy.&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Jape paused and pinched the bridge of his nose with two fingers. &quot;Class dismissed. Your homework is to write an essay with the title 'What I love most about insects and arthropods'. Two thousand words minimum.&quot;</p><p></p>
