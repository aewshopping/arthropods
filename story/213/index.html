The wake up call<br>
<span class="text-size-x2">⏰</span></h1>
<div>
<p>You wake up feeling refreshed and happy but are momentarily unsure of where you are... Then it comes back to you and you laugh out loud with delight.
</p><p>You are a student at the Hogsnorts School of Magic, you've been picked for the best house (Snakefang) and you have been given your very own tower to live in, complete with living room, study, kitchen, magically replenishing larder, astronomical observatory, bedroom and ensuite bathroom.</p>
<p>What's more you have a new best friend: Snako Malboy.</p>
<p>Which reminds you, Snako was allocated the tower next to you, and you wonder if he is up yet.</p>
<p>You quickly throw on your clothes and dash down the spiral iron staircases until you are at the bottom of your tower and head out of the door.</p>
<p>You almost bump into Snako who was dashing out of his tower to come and see you.</p>
<p>&quot;Snako&quot; you say, &quot;Isn't it amazing to have our own tower!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's super cool,&quot; said Snako, &quot;and I got a mint chocolate on my pillow! But listen, Arthur, I'm thinking we should spend today exploring the Snakefang House tower. We can go to lessons tomorrow, no-one will miss us.&quot;</p><p></p>
