Beetle battle<br>
<span class="text-size-x2">ðŸª²</span></h1>
<div>
<p>You find yourself face to face with a trio of bombardier beetles, who seem to be guarding the way. 
</p><p>&quot;My goodness!&quot; says Kensley. &quot;They are not friendly one bit!&quot;</p>
<p>One of them makes an angry chittering sound. Even though you don't speak beetle you are pretty sure this beetle doesn't like you.</p>
<p>The three beetles turn around in the corridor to face away from you.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur do you think they're running away?&quot; asks Kensley, tugging on your sleeve.</p>
<p>Suddenly there is a loud popping sound and a steam of superheated liquid shoots out of the beetles' bottoms.</p>
<p>&quot;Duck!&quot; you cry, and you and Kensely throw yourself to one side. The liquid misses you by inches. The stone flagstone bubbles and fizzes where the liquid struck it.</p>
<p>You both pick yourself up off the floor and scramble back round the corner for safety.</p>
<p>&quot;That was too close,&quot; you say. &quot;We need to get past those creatures or we will never be able to get down into the dungeon.&quot;</p>
<p>You think hard, there must be a spell that you can use. Some spell that allows you to sneak past without them seeing you.</p>
<p>After a moment, a determined look in your eye, you step out from your hiding place with your wand at the ready.</p><p></p>
