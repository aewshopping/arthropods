<p>The next day all the children are called to the school hall for a special announcement.
</p><p>As you take your seats at the house tables you notice that the ceiling has been enchanted to a beautiful sky blue with fluffy clouds scudding past on one side and a flock of pterosaurs fighting to the death on the other.</p>
<p>&quot;Students,&quot; announces Slumblebore from the front of the hall. &quot;I have a very special announcement. Yesterday, unbeknownst to us, we were threatened by a vast and evil insect horde gathering in the school dungeon.&quot;</p>
<p>Slumblebore casts a severe glance at professor Knid, who looks down sheepishly at the table.</p>
<p>&quot;We were saved thanks to the bravery, resourcefulness and gumption of one boy.</p>
<p>&quot;That boy is Arthur Otley.&quot;</p>
<p>You feel your cheeks go red as all the students in the school turn round to get a look at you and you hear whispers of &quot;yes that's him&quot;, &quot;defeated the insects single handed!&quot;, &quot;still just a first year!&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;In recognition of his outstanding services to Hogsnorts School I am pleased to award: one million points to Lionpaw House!&quot;</p>
<p>Deafening cheers come from the Lionpaw House students all around you.</p>
<p>&quot;Did you hear that?&quot; cries Aaron Bleezeley. &quot;A million points! Last year the Lionpaw house only got 600 points for the whole year! We'll win the House Cup for sure, well done Arthur!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What is more,&quot; continues Slumblebore, &quot;any unused Lionpaw House points will carry over from one year to the next. Which by my calculation means that Lionpaw House will win the House Cup for approximately the next... one hundred years.&quot; Slumblebore beams at you through his beard.</p>
<p>&quot;Lastly I hereby announce a new order of wizardry: the Order of the Arthropods. Arthur I grant you first class membership of the Order. Three cheers for Arthur Otley, hero of the school and founding member of the Order of the Arthropods!&quot;</p>
<p>The cheers ring out over and over again. The Lionpaw students raise you up on your shoulders and carry you round and round the school hall in triumph shouting &quot;Hooray for Arthur, hero of the school!&quot;</p>
<p>CONGRATULATIONS - YOU HAVE ACHIEVED THE HERO OF THE SCHOOL ENDING</p><p></p>
