The dungeon door<br>
<span class="text-size-x2">ðŸšª</span></h1>
<div>
<p>You enter the passageway sloping downwards and after many twists and turns in the passageway you are hopelessly lost.
</p><p>You notice a fascinating little spider running around a corner ahead of you - possibly a member of the <em>paratropididae</em> spider family. Curiously it then comes back round the corner, looks at you and waits, then lifts up a spindly leg and points.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur&quot; says Daniel, &quot;I think that spider wants us to follow him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Truly remarkable,&quot; you reply. &quot;It appears to be demonstrating significantly more intelligent behaviour than the average spider. Let's see where it is going.&quot;</p>
<p>You follow the spider as it turns this way then that and are amazed and delighted to finally arrive at what must surely be the entrance to the dungeon.</p>
<p>&quot;This is it Daniel,&quot; you say. &quot;We've found it!&quot;</p>
<p>A huge wooden door, banded with silver inlaid iron, stands within a stone archway. Either side of the door two antique sets of armour are positioned upright as if on guard.</p>
<p>The spider you were following scurries through the keyhole of the door and disappears.</p>
<p>Above the door there is a sign written in some archaic font, which reads: &quot;DUNGEON&quot;.</p>
<p>You try the doorknob but it doesn't budge.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a magical enchantment of locking on the door!&quot; says Daniel. &quot;We will need to cast a counter spell if we are to get through.&quot;</p>
<p>As you lift up your wand, you think carefully about a spell that could work.</p><p></p>
