<p>"Good morning Brian Banana!"
</p><p>&quot;Good morning Arthur!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good morning Kensley Potato. Kensley! Kensley? Now where has she disappeared to...?</p>
<p>&quot;Good morning Rebecca Radishbottom!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good morning Arthur!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good morning Azog the Great!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good morning young Arthur!&quot;</p>
<p>You sit down on the bench next to Azog, outside the insects' Hogger Hole, and enjoy the feeling of the mid morning sun on your face.</p>
<p>It's been a year since you led the insect horde out of the school dungeon to their new abode, a year of hard work, a year of peace.</p>
<p>You still remember those first days as if it were yesterday. Kensley was delighted to find you alive and well and even more delighted when you gave her back the ring she dropped.</p>
<p>The other Hedgehog House students were initially uneasy about an insect army moving in next door, but you passionately defended them, explaining that this was the only way to end generations of suffering - of insect bites and wasp stings versus crushed ants and swatted flies.</p>
<p>Acceptance from the Hoggers only came in full measure when the insects started helping out with the vegetable gardens, keeping the plants free from pests and nourishing them with their own tiny droppings. If a snail gave into temptation and nibbled on a lettuce leaf he was soon restrained by his fellow creatures.</p>
<p>The Hoggers were thrilled and the arthropods were here to stay.</p>
<p>&quot;How are the little ones Azog?&quot; you ask kindly.</p>
<p>&quot;Coming along very well, thank you Arthur. There's a new batch of ten thousand ants hatching this week, and fifteen thousand fly larvae will be pupating shortly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's wonderful news,&quot; you reply. You are particularly happy about the flies as they are the eyes and ears of the colony, buzzing off to investigate the doings of neighbouring shires.</p>
<p>&quot;And how about your carrots Arthur?&quot;</p>
<p>You reach into your basket and proudly pull out a bunch of carrots of monstrous size, each as big as a squidditch stick.</p>
<p>&quot;I will win first prize at the fair for sure!&quot; you reply. &quot;I couldn't be happier - and I couldn't do it without the insects! Their manure is first rate.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The droppings of the arthropods - not to be sniffed at. But it's the least we can do to say thank you. From the first moment I saw you I knew you were the special one. Thank you Arthur. Thank you for leading us here. We have peace in our time because of you, and it is small recompense to provide you with the ordure of the arthropods.&quot;</p>
<p>CONGRATULATIONS, YOU HAVE ACHIEVED THE LIVING IN HARMONY WITH INSECTS ENDING</p><p></p>
