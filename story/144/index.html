<div>
<p>The first kid to step forward is a boy named Snako Malboy from Snakefang house. Azog is perched on your shoulder and hisses in satisfaction as the pale boy approaches nervously. 
</p><p>Snako signs his name in your register and then utters a cry of alarm as Azog leaps onto his neck and sinks his sharp spider fangs into his ear lobe. But it is only to extract a harmless DNA sample from the boy's blood, and when the other children realise this more and more of them approach in the hopes that they too will be made superhuman.</p>
<p>Then the hard work begins.</p>
<p>With Azog, Daniel Colliers Wood and some of the more intelligent Ravenwing students you lock yourselves into a magical laboratory with the childrens' DNA samples. Collecting additional DNA from your insect army it is not long before you have created a powerful hybrid human-insect DNA serum, which you further refine into substrains for isolated traits: wings, antenna, hairy legs and so on.</p>
<p>By the time of school assembly on the following day you are ready.</p>
<p>&quot;Fellow students!&quot; you shout, holding up your hands for silence. &quot;All those who signed up for the human-insect hybridisation program come to front of the hall!&quot;</p>
<p>You instruct them to line up according to whichever insect enhancement they desire: one line for wings, another line for antennae, another for hairy legs and so on.</p>
<p>Each student swallows a magical pill the size and shape of a bluebottle and the transformations begin!</p>
<p>Yells of laughter and delight fill the great hall as the students sprout translucent wings out of their backs, long probing antennae from their foreheads and grow great ugly black hairs on their legs.</p>
<p>In no time at all they are zooming through the air, climbing up the walls and leaping from table to table, reveling in their amazing new powers - the age of the superhuman has begun!</p>
<p>But now it is time for the second - secret - part of your plan.</p>
<p>You and Daniel sneak back to the magical laboratory as the other kids fool around in the great hall. Even Azog doesn't know what you have planned now.</p>
<p>Back at the laboratory you quickly combine the different DNA serums into a single super fluid and mix in two hairs, freshly plucked from each of your heads. The liquid turns electric blue and froths golden bubbles.</p>
<p>You pour it into two matching goblets and hand one to Daniel. Clinking the glasses you look Daniel in the eye.</p>
<p>&quot;See you on the next brain plane.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'll drink to that!&quot; he replies and you both drain your glasses.</p>
<p>The other students and Azog have all of them been deceived. Into each serum you secretly added some termite DNA which has created a hive mind link directly to your and Daniel's brains, activated by your drink.</p>
<p>The brain power of all the children has been added to yours making you and Daniel 100 times cleverer than the cleverest person in human history. As an added bonus, every insect, and each student, is now under your direct control.</p>
<p>Too late the children flying around the Great Hall with their fantastic insect wings realise their predicament and their cries of dismay ring out.</p>
<p>You and Daniel smile at each other, a smile of superman intelligence and understanding. Communicating by pure brainwaves you speak directly into his mind:</p>
<p>&quot;This experiment has been most satisfactory - what shall be our next invention?&quot;</p>
<p>CONGRATULATIONS YOU HAVE ACHIEVED THE SUPERHUMAN MASTERMIND ENDING</p><p></p>
