Measuring up<br>

<p>"Toast will burn and porridge bubble, measure this kid and save me the trouble!" shrieked witch number 2.
</p><p>The incantation complete, the magic tape measure zooms around your body like a whirlwind, measuring everything from your inside leg measurement, to the distance between your nostrils, to the length of your ear lobes.</p>
<p>At the same time a magic biro is writing down all these measurements on a notepad.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, in which you are frightened to move in case the tape measure accidentally shoots up your nose, the tape neatly rolls itself up and lands on a table.</p>
<p>Witch number 2 looks carefully at the scribbled numbers in the notepad and counts on her fingers.</p>
<p>She looks up at her sister and yells: &quot;Small!&quot;</p>
<p>As witch number 1 scuttles off to get a small robe for you, your Mum, who has been standing quietly to one side clears her throat.</p>
<p>&quot;Ahem, how much do these robes cost? I didn't see any prices when we came in the shop,&quot; says your Mum.</p>
<p>&quot;11 Golden Frigates and not an Acorn less!&quot; replies the witch.</p>
<p>&quot;11 Golden Frigates - how much is that in pounds?&quot; asks your Mum.</p>
<p>&quot;Pounds? Oh no deary, we only take wizard money in this shop.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Never mind Mum,&quot; you say, &quot;I'm sure we could just make the robes ourselves from some black material...&quot;</p>
<p>Snako Malboy snorts and rolls his eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Wait!&quot; exclaims the witch, &quot;We don't take pounds but we do offer <em>wagers</em>.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ok... can we do a wager and not pay anything?&quot; asks your mum.</p>
<p>&quot;I wager you can't guess my age,&quot; says the witch. &quot;If you can, you can keep the robe and get a free hat. If you fail you will stay in this shop for ever!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'll do it&quot; you say bravely, &quot;but I will need a clue.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How old are you boy?&quot; asks the witch.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm ten years old.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Here's your clue. In ten years, if you double your age then, and then double it again, that will be my age then. But how old am I, right now?&quot;</p><p></p>

<p>1. Turn to the number that is the age of the witch ~ <strong><a href="/arthropods/story/70">Go to the number of your answer</a></strong></p>
<p>2. This wager is too risky, you decide to get your wand instead ~ <strong><a href="/arthropods/story/64">Go to number 64</a></strong></p>
<p>3. That witch could be any age up to a thousand! You decide to get your year 1 spellbook instead ~ <strong><a href="/arthropods/story/37">Go to number 37</a></strong></p>
