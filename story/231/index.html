Beetle battle<br>
ðŸª²</h1>
<div class="text-justify">
<p>You find yourself face to face with a trio of bombardier beetles, who seem to be guarding the way. 
</p><p>&quot;Look how large these three fine specimens are!&quot; says Daniel. &quot;I wonder how they will react to a human presence?&quot;</p>
<p>You find out immediately: as one of them makes an angry chittering sound. Even though you don't understand the beetle exactly, you are pretty sure he or she or it doesn't like you.</p>
<p>The three beetles turn around in the corridor to face away from you.</p>
<p>&quot;How curious, they seem to be retreating&quot; remarks Daniel with a puzzled look.</p>
<p>Suddenly there is a loud popping sound and an aqueous solution of hydroquinones and hydrogen peroxides shoots out of the beetles' posterior regions.</p>
<p>&quot;Duck!&quot; you cry, and you and Daniel throw yourself to one side. The liquid misses you by inches. The stone flagstone bubbles and fizzes where the liquid struck it.</p>
<p>You both pick yourself up off the floor and scramble back round the corner for safety.</p>
<p>&quot;That was too close,&quot; you say. &quot;We need to find a way to immobilise those beetles, or distract them somehow.&quot;</p>
<p>You think hard, there must be a spell that you can use that would incapacitate those three remarkable creatures, preferably without harming them so they can be studied later.</p>
<p>After a moment, with a determined spring in your step, you decide. You leap out from your hiding place, your wand at the ready.</p><p></p>
