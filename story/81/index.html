<p>"Yes! 81 is the number - fantastic!" says Wally, beaming with delight.
</p><p>&quot;Our minds have a strong magical connection and I can see that you are truly a worthy wandholder, and deserving of my special 100% discount. I can also determine which wand will match you <em>exactly</em>.&quot;</p>
<p>Wally starts muttering to himself and he strides between the cabinets.</p>
<p>&quot;Flexible? Yes but not too much... The action will be important... More benign than malign that's for sure...&quot;</p>
<p>All of sudden Wally stops next to a cabinet and reaches inside.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes!&quot; he shouts and holds up a brown wand. &quot;This is the one, Arthur. Hold it!&quot;</p>
<p>You take it from his hand and it feels... right. Like it has always belonged to you - but that somehow <em>you</em> also belong to <em>the wand</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;An excellent match!&quot; says Wally &quot;Made of wood from the heart of the wishing tree, with a core of spider silk from the bottom of the great spider king himself, and curiously enough, one of my own beard hairs. Give it a wave Arthur.&quot;</p>
<p>You give the wand a bit of a shake. Effortlessly little sparks of gold zap off the end and ping into the walls. You feel magical power surge through your arm.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you very much Mr Wally&quot; says your Mum.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you Wally&quot; you say.</p>
<p>NO. THANK <em>YOU</em>! says Wally speaking directly into your mind. He looks at you and winks.</p><p></p>
