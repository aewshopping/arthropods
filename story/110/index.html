Dinner time<br>
<span class="text-size-x2">üçΩÔ∏è</span></h1>
<div>
<p>Joining a gaggle of other Hogger students you head off on the long winding route back to the Hogsnorts Great Hall to get your dinner.
</p><p>You take a seat at the Hedgehog table and look around you, amazed.</p>
<p>Tonight Slumblebore has enchanted the walls and ceiling of the Great Hall to look like a lush and humid jungle. But the perspective of the students sitting in the hall is as if they are a tiny creature in the undergrowth - blades of grass tower above them, giant ants scurry past and occasionally birds that appear to be the size of aeroplanes swoop overhead.</p>
<p>You stare wide eyed as a stag beetle lumbers past you, each footstep making the ground vibrate. It is a fantastic, incredible scene, and a bit scary</p>
<p>&quot;Don't forget to eat Arthur!&quot; Kensley reminds you with a smile.</p>
<p>You look down to see yet another incredible feast.</p>
<p>In keeping with the enchanted hall, where the ceiling and walls show everything huge, normal food has been enchanted to an enormous size. Garden peas the size of tennis balls are piled on a plate. Sausages the size of small boats lie lengthways on the table swimming in gravy. Roast potatoes bigger than your head sit in a dish that would be considered big if it was a bathtub.</p>
<p>It is all so delicious you can't stop an involuntary dribble which you quickly wipe from your chin with the table cloth.</p>
<p>You cram food into your mouth and gulp it down.</p>
<p>In a bizarre magical twist, as soon as the food is in your tummy it returns to its normal size, so you have to eat vast quantities of the enchanted sausage and veg to fill yourself up. This suits you and Kensley just fine - eating is one of your favourite things!</p>
<p>When you are finally reaching the end of the meal the enchanted scene suddenly transforms into a terrific battle as a stream of army ants overruns the jungle undergrowth attacking everything in their path with their fearsome mandibles. The Great Hall appears to be <em>picked up</em> and <em>carried along</em> by these implacable insects, and enchanted chairs tilt crazily as you ride along on the back of the army ant horde.</p>
<p>It is looking grim for the students and several Hedgehog House students, including Kensley, vomit on the floor, overcome with fright and motion sickness.</p>
<p>But just at the point the ants are taking the Great Hall down into their underground lair, in this intricate magical simulation, a small herd of ant-eaters charge onto the scene. Their long flexible tongues lash out from side to side, slurping up ants by the thousand and soon the army ant horde is no more, leaving the Great Hall in peace once more on the forest floor.</p>
<p>&quot;Hooray for Hogsnorts, hooray for Slumblebore!&quot; you shout, delighted at the evening's entertainment, even if it was a bit scary. You lead the Hoggers in a chant of &quot;Hoggers up, Hoggers down, Hoggers hoggers stand your ground&quot; and everyone cheers in general merriment, ending the best dinner you have ever had.</p>
<p>Turning to Kensley you say.</p><p></p>
