Wesley the Weasel<br>
üçá</h1>
<div class="text-justify">
<p>You reach out a hand to pet the weasel, who meekly inclines his head to you and allows himself to be stroked.
<p>&quot;Ah yes, I see Wesley likes you!&quot; comments Slumblebore. &quot;I'm not surprised though because he likes all Lionpaw House students: he was once in Lionpaw House himself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I didn't know weasels could study magic in Hogsnorts!&quot; you exclaim.</p>
<p>&quot;They can't, but then Wesley was not always a weasel. He was not always called Wesley either. Let me explain.</p>
<p>&quot;Wesley used to be a real boy just like you Arthur. Then one day in an ill-tempered dispute with a fellow student about who had the fastest broomstick, he was transformed by magic into the weasel you see before you. Unfortunately the spell was permanent.&quot;</p>
<p>Wesley listens to all this intently, and he leaps onto Slumblebore's desk, chattering his teeth in rage and frustration.</p>
<p>&quot;As Wesley was an orphan I realised that the kindest thing to do would be to adopt him as my pet. My tailor on Hippotomews specially made his red waistcoat and matching hat. And I decided to give him his new name: Wesley, because Wesley the Weasel has a rather pleasing ring to it, don't you think? His boy name before that was Gary, which would never do. Or possibly it was Barry.</p>
<p>&quot;Every since then he has lived with me. We get along famously although I must admit that his table manners are not all that they might be - he has an unfortunate habit of defecating in the raisins.&quot;</p>
<p>Wesley hangs his head, shamefacedly.</p>
<p>&quot;You can easily tell which is which though,&quot; says Slumblebore brightening. &quot;The raisins have a sort of skin to them whereas the droppings are the same texture all the way through.</p>
<p>&quot;Why do I tell you all this Arthur? I want you to know that for all my students I will always be there for them. I will always be there for you, when you need help the most. Always, Arthur, always. Metaphorically. Just like I was for Barry. Or was it Larry.</p></p>
