Picked for Snakefang<br>

<div class="text-justify">
<p>Snakefang House! I must be in Snakefang House.
</p><p>Coo coo Snakefang House is it? I can see that in this house you would be strong and powerful. But are you sure? asks Percy the pigeon, speaking directly into your mind now. Snakefangs are a bit, you know: evil...&quot;</p>
<p>Yes yes, you think back at him. Not a do-gooder Lionpaw, not a too-clever-by-half Ravenclaw, not a boring old Hedgehog. I want to be a Snakefang - better than all of them!</p>
<p>Coo coo as you wish young Arthur, speaks Percy into your brain.</p>
<p>Slowly the great yellow eyes shrink to normal size and you are just staring at a regular giant talking pigeon again.</p>
<p>Percy waddles over to the centre of the hole where the light from the hall shines down. He looks old and weak - you wonder how long he has been doing this. For decades? Centuries even?</p>
<p>The giant pigeon settles down on the floor, and coos once or twice. He then stands up slowly and waddles back into the darkness at the edge of the hole that is his home. On the floor he has laid a large and beautiful egg.</p>
<p>The egg is striped in colours of silver and green. The colours of Snakefang House!</p>
<p>Your heart pounding with excitement, you pick up the egg and slowly walk back up the wooden stairs to the noise and light of the Hogsnorts Great Hall.</p>
<p>As you emerge out of the pigeon hole, Slumblebore sees your egg and shouts: &quot;Arthur Otley, Snakefang House!&quot;</p><p></p>
