The wake up call<br>
<span class="text-size-x2">⏰</span></h1>
<div>
<p>As you wake, for a moment you are confused where you are. You can hear the sound of birds chirping through an open window and there is a faint woody aroma in the air. 
</p><p>Then, with a warm glow, you remember. You are in Ravenwing House Tower, and your new home-away-from-home is in the inside of a giant magical tree. As well as having the largest library in the history of the world (past and future), it also has a lovely en-suite bedroom just for you with a cosy living room attached. You sigh happily - the life of a wizard is not bad at all.</p>
<p>Then you remember that your new best friend Daniel Colliers-Wood also has a bedroom next door, so you throw your clothes on and dash out to find him.</p>
<p>As you run out of your room into the wooden corridor you see Daniel dashing along the corridor towards you.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur this tower is amazing! There's so much to see. Let's explore the Ravenwing tower today and skip our lessons.&quot;</p><p></p>

<p>2. "Great idea," you reply. "We can always catch up on school work tomorrow!" ~ <strong><a href="/arthropods/story/119">Go to number 119</a></strong></p>
