Back to the Tower<br>
üèØ</h1>
<div class="text-justify">
<p>"Let's go back to the House Tower," you say to Daniel. "I'm tired out, it must be really late now."
<p>The two of you trudge wearily back to the Ravenwing House Tower. It is a long way but somehow you remember the path perfectly - perhaps due to some 'homing' magic that all Ravenwing's absorb when they ate their house picking egg from Percy the Pigeon.</p>
<p>Before long you have found your way through the winding pathways and are inside the great living tree that forms the tower. Most of the parrots are roosting far above you but a few are still awake and squawk a welcome as they fly above your heads.</p>
<p>You feel your spirits rise: could anyone have a better home to come back to than this?</p>
<p>You both wearily ascend the wooden ramp that spirals upwards on the inside of the great tree trunk until you have reached your rooms.</p>
<p>&quot;Goodnight Arthur,&quot; says Daniel with a yawn. &quot;See you in the morning.&quot;</p>
<p>Pushing open your door, you go inside. As if by magic everything has been tidied away and cleaned up. Throwing your robes over the sofa, you have a quick refreshing shower in your bathroom, dry yourself with an enormous fluffy white towel, stumble to your cosy little bedroom and drift peacefully off to sleep.</p></p>
