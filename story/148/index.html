<p>The next day all the children are called to the school hall for a special announcement.
</p><p>As you take your seats at the house tables you notice that the ceiling has been enchanted to a beautiful sky blue with fluffy clouds scudding past on one side and a fleet of giant floating zeppelins racing each other on the other.</p>
<p>&quot;Students,&quot; announces Slumblebore from the front of the hall. &quot;I have a very special announcement. Yesterday, unbeknownst to us, we were threatened by a vast and evil insect horde gathering in the school dungeon.&quot;</p>
<p>Slumblebore casts a severe glance at professor Knid, who looks down sheepishly at the table.</p>
<p>&quot;We were saved thanks to the bravery, resourcefulness and pure gumption of one boy.</p>
<p>&quot;That boy is Arthur Otley.&quot;</p>
<p>You feel proud and important as all the students in the school turn round to get a look at you and you hear whispers of &quot;yes that's him&quot;, &quot;defeated the insects single handed!&quot;, &quot;still just a first year!&quot;, and &quot;wouldn't mess with that fella!&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;In recognition of his outstanding services to Hogsnorts School I am pleased to award: one million points to Snakefang House!&quot;</p>
<p>Deafening cheers come from the Snakefang House students all around you.</p>
<p>&quot;Did you hear that?&quot; cries Snako Malboy. &quot;A million points! Last year the Snakefang house only got 500 points for the whole year! Now no-one will be able to beat us to the House Cup!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What is more,&quot; continues Slumblebore, &quot;any unused Snakefang House points will carry over from one year to the next. Which by my calculation means that Snakefang House will win the House Cup for approximately the next... one hundred years.&quot; Slumblebore beams at you through his beard.</p>
<p>&quot;Lastly I hereby announce a new order of wizardry: the Order of the Arthropods. Arthur I grant you first class membership of the Order. Three cheers for Arthur Otley, hero of the school and founding member of the Order of the Arthropods!&quot;</p>
<p>The cheers ring out over and over again. The Snakefang students raise you up on your shoulders and carry you round and round the school hall in triumph shouting &quot;Hooray for Arthur!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wait!&quot; you cry. &quot;Professor Slumblebore, there is one more thing that I demand as my price for saving the school. I want all students, even the lumps in Lionpaw, to repeat after me.&quot;</p>
<p>Slumblebore nods - he knows how much he owes you.</p>
<p>&quot;Snakefang House rules! Yah sssssssss!&quot;</p>
<p>As you stick your tongue out and waggle it from side to side you are delighted to see all the other students in the school copy you.</p>
<p>You are even more delighted to see the expressions of extreme reluctance and distaste on the faces of the Lionpaw students as they repeat the Snakefang House chant, the chant of their oldest enemies.</p>
<p>You savour the sweet taste of victory and sneer at everybody.</p>
<p>CONGRATULATIONS - YOU HAVE ACHIEVED THE RUB YOUR ENEMIES NOSES IN YOUR OWN SUCCESS ENDING</p><p></p>
