Knid&#39;s insects<br>

<div class="text-justify">
<p>You raise your hand and ask "Please sir. Aren't lions better than insects? They're much bigger and stronger."
</p><p>&quot;Spoken like a true Lionpaw student! Lions! Pshaw. But Lionpaws are not known for their intelligence. No boy lions are <em>not</em> better than insects.</p>
<p>&quot;Firstly: lions can't fly but insects can. Insects have been flying for over 350 million years! And we are always so impressed by the birds. Look at me, look at my feathers, I'm a bird! But insects have been flying for twice as long as birds - birds only evolved 150 million years ago. Pathetic.</p>
<p>&quot;Secondly: a lion may look strong but even an ant is stronger. An ant can carry up to fifty times its own body weight. A lion would struggle to give another lion a piggy back. An ant is more than fifty times stronger than a lion!</p>
<p>&quot;Thirdly: how many lions are there in the world? Not many I can tell you. Or how many mammals even? So all the lions, humans, cows, horses, mice and dogs put together?</p>
<p>Mammals make up only 0.4% of all animal species.</p>
<p>Insects species make up 70% of all animal species, and if we include all arthropods that's over 80%. That means for every one mammal species (like a lion) there are <em>170 insect species</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;No, it is clear to me, as it should now be clear to you, that lions are pitiful, almost inconsequential creatures compared to insects and arthropods.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But sir,&quot; interrupts Aaron, &quot;insects <em>are</em> a bit disgusting...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh the prejudice! They may also find you disgusting young man but does that make you so? There will come a day - and maybe sooner than you think - when everyone will appreciate the beauty of an insect, when people don't shudder when I brush past them with my cloak. Yes you will appreciate those 'disgusting' insects soon enough my boy.&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Jape paused and pinched the bridge of his nose with two fingers. &quot;Class dismissed. Your homework is to write an essay with the title 'What I love most about insects and arthropods'. Two thousand words minimum.&quot;</p><p></p>
