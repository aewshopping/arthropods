<p>You elbow your way to the front of the queue. You can't wait to see what will happen next! 
</p><p>&quot;Arthur Otley&quot; says Slumblebore, &quot;as you are first in line, please go down into the hole.&quot;</p>
<p>You feel very excited and a bit nervous. What amazing things could be down there? Will you have to do a test to get into a House? Fight a monster perhaps? Fight this mysterious singing Percy?</p>
<p>You carefully go down the steps into the darkness. You descend until all you can see above you is a circle of light and the noise of the hall fades to nothing.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello? Percy?&quot;</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>Then: &quot;Coo coo come closer, so I can see you better!&quot;</p>
<p>The voice emerging from the blackness in front of you has a strange high pitched musical quality to it. Fear closes your throat and you are rooted to the spot. Then... ouch! Something has bitten you on the bum! You see a small spider dropping off your robes and scurrying away into the darkness.</p>
<p>The pain in your bum gets you moving. You slowly walk forwards.</p>
<p>As you get closer you can just make out two round yellow eyes staring back at you, and between them a large... beak? Is Percy some kind of monster? It doesn't look or sound dangerous...</p>
<p>Your eyes adjust to the dark and you realise that you are staring at a gigantic pigeon, that's as tall as you are, even sitting down.</p>
<p>&quot;Who are you?&quot; you ask.</p>
<p>&quot;Coo coo I'm Percy the Picking Pigeon and I will choose your house for you coo coo! Look into my eyes Arthur, look into my eyes...&quot;</p>
<p>You stare into the yellow eyes of the pigeon which seem to grow until they become the entire world.</p>
<p>&quot;Coo coo, well, you are brave Arthur to come here first,&quot; says Percy. &quot;Ambitious perhaps, and clever too. You could be a Lionpaw fighting for the truth. Or a Snakefang rising to the top. Or a Ravenwing mastering the secrets of the universe. But certainly not a cowardly Hedgehog House. Coo coo.&quot;</p>
<p>As Percy the Picking Pigeon probes your mind, you concentrate with all your being, repeating to yourself:</p><p></p>
