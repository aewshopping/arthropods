<p>Before you can stop him Dad grabs the letter from your hands, rips it into tiny pieces and throws it into the recycling bin.
</p><p>&quot;There's no point in reading that rubbish&quot; says Dad, &quot;it's just someone trying to sell you double glazing or something.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But Dad, that was for me! It had my name on it!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You should see the stuff I get with my name on it!&quot; replies Dad. &quot;Selling windows, selling contact lenses, selling insurance. No it's better off in the recycling bin where it can be put to a good use, like making toilet paper.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But Da-ad!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sorry Arthur, but we don't need new windows, you're too young for contact lenses and we've already got insurance. Anyway who wants to hear my latest song...&quot;</p>
<p>You sigh as Dad starts singing the song he has written.</p>
<p>You are sure that there was something really <em>important</em> about that letter. Something really <em>special</em>.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The next morning as you munch your toast, you hear the letter box flap open.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur!&quot; shouts Evan from the front door. &quot;There's another letter for you!&quot;</p>
<p>Another letter! You must be really popular!</p>
<p>You race down the hallway to get the letter, but your Dad is already there with the letter in his hands and a frown on his face.</p>
<p>&quot;More junk mail!&quot; he says.</p>
<p>Do you:</p><p></p>
