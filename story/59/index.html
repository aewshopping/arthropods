<p>Hedgehog House! I want to be in Hedgehog House.
</p><p>Coo coo are you sure it's Hedgehog House? asks Percy the pigeon, speaking directly into your mind now.</p>
<p>Yes please, you think back at him. Not a slimey Snakefang, not a meathead Lionpaw, not a smarty pants Ravenclaw. I don't want any trouble, I just want to be in Hedgehog House!</p>
<p>Coo coo as you wish young Arthur, speaks Percy into your brain.</p>
<p>Slowly the great yellow eyes shrink to normal size and you are just staring at a regular giant talking pigeon again.</p>
<p>Percy waddles over to the centre of the hole where the light from the hall shines down. He looks old and you wonder how long he has been doing this. For decades? Centuries even?</p>
<p>The giant pigeon settles down on the floor, and coos once or twice. He then stands up slowly and waddles back into the darkness at the edge of the hole that is his home. On the floor he has laid a large and beautiful egg.</p>
<p>The egg is a dull brown colour stripes. The colour of Hedgehog House!</p>
<p>Your heart pounding with excitement, you pick up the egg and slowly walk back up the wooden stairs to the noise and light of the Hogsnorts Great Hall.</p>
<p>As you emerge out of the pigeon hole, Slumblebore sees your egg and shouts: &quot;Arthur Otley, Hedgehog House!&quot;</p><p></p>

<p>1. You walk over to the Hedgehog House table, holding your egg aloft. ~ <strong><a href="/arthropods/story/275">Go to number 275</a></strong></p>
