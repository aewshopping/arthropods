<p>After taking over the school it was easy to recruit new students to your side. Attracted to your power the whole of Snakefang House joined you immediately. The Ravenclaws took a little bit longer to win over but after you had put a few of them in the dungeon for a while, most of them realised that you were serious and joined your force. The Hoggers of Hedgehog House joined you when the Ravenclaws gave in.
</p><p>It was only the Lionpaws who didn't join you but by then you already had enough students to put the second part of your plan into action.</p>
<p>You split the students into groups of four. Each quartet was assigned a small insect army to help them. Using teleportation magic each group went to a different country and sneaked into the president's house.</p>
<p>At exactly the same minute of the same hour of the same day your magical minions appeared before the presidents of every country in the world, whether they were in their office, asleep in the bedrooms or having a bath.</p>
<p>You personally assigned yourself the President of the United States, Snako at your side.</p>
<p>&quot;What the...? What's goin' on here? Who are you guys?&quot; floundered the president of the United States as you, Snako, two other wizards and a million termites materialise out of thin air into the Oval Office.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't bother to call your guards Mr President&quot; you say with a wolfish grin, &quot;They are fast asleep in the next room and they won't wake up until you tickle them under the armpits. I am here to inform you that a new world order has begun! The Order of the Arthropods! From now on you take orders only from me.&quot;</p>
<p>The President didn't like it - of course he didn't - but you menace him with the termites and he sees he has no choice.</p>
<p>Putting an enchanted earwig behind his ear, you explain to the president that whenever you have orders for him you will communicate through the earwig who will whisper into his ear hole.</p>
<p>&quot;You'd better do whatever he says Mr President&quot; adds Snako, &quot;Otherwise we'll set the termites on you.&quot;</p>
<p>And then you vanish, leaving behind a puff of smoke and a million twenties who crawl into cracks in the floor and walls, ready to spring out if called.</p>
<p>The next morning the world wakes up to some startling news. All the presidents of every country in the world have simultaneously announced three new laws for everyone:</p>
<ul>
<li>All the children of the world are allowed to play video games for as long as they like every day (even if it is bedtime).</li>
<li>Ice cream (at least three flavours) will be made available at every meal, as a starter.</li>
<li>Harming insects is a crime.</li>
</ul>
<p>You smile happily as you listen to the news on the television while licking your breakfast ice cream.</p>
<p>You wonder what your next instructions will be...</p>
<p>CONGRATULATIONS - YOU HAVE ACHIEVED THE WORLD DOMINATION ENDING!</p><p></p>
