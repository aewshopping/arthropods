Measuring up<br>
<span class="text-size-x2">üìè</span></h1>
<div>
<p>"Toast will burn and porridge bubble, measure this kid and save me the trouble!" shrieked witch number 2.
</p><p>The incantation complete, the magic tape measure zooms around your body like a whirlwind, measuring everything from your inside leg measurement, to the distance between your nostrils, to the length of your ear lobes.</p>
<p>At the same time a magic biro is writing down all these measurements on a notepad.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, in which you are frightened to move in case the tape measure accidentally shoots up your nose, the tape neatly rolls itself up and lands on a table.</p>
<p>Witch number 2 looks carefully at the scribbled numbers in the notepad and counts on her fingers.</p>
<p>She looks up at her sister and yells: &quot;Small!&quot;</p>
<p>As witch number 1 scuttles off to get a small robe for you, your Mum, who has been standing quietly to one side clears her throat.</p>
<p>&quot;Is there any chance we could do some sort of challenge or test?&quot; your mum asks. &quot;And get a discount of say, 100%? I'm afraid we didn't bring any wizard money...&quot;</p>
<p>Snako Malboy snorts and rolls his eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;A test? A challenge? No deary. What we like are <em>wagers</em>&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ok whatever. Can we do a wager and not pay anything?&quot; your mum says.</p>
<p>&quot;I wager you can't guess my age. If you can, you can keep the robe and get a free hat. If you fail you will stay in this shop for ever!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'll do it&quot; you say bravely, &quot;but I will need a clue.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How old are you boy?&quot; asks the witch.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm ten years old.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Here's your clue. If you multiply your age by ten, then add nine... That's the age I will be in ten year's time. How old am I, right now?&quot;</p><p></p>

<p>1. Turn to the number that is the age of the witch ~ <strong><a href="/arthropods/story/99">Go to the number of your answer</a></strong></p>
<p>2. You are starting to feel very uncomfortable... you make your excuses, run out the door and go to get your spellbook instead. ~ <strong><a href="/arthropods/story/51">Go to number 51</a></strong></p>
