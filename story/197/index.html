Epilogue<br>
ðŸªµ</h1>
<div class="text-justify">
<p>The next few years pass happily at the school. 
<p>You construct a dizzyingly high tower at the centre of the school, taller than all of the other house towers put together. The insects assist you with the building work, with the ants and termites being particularly helpful.</p>
<p>You make sure that it has the best waterslides, the best lava pools, the best library in the school and invite select other students to join you, such as Daniel Colliers-Wood, Kensley Potato and the rest of the Bleezeley family. Even Eric King is allowed a room in the tower. Snako Malboy is not allowed in.</p>
<p>Azog teaches you all a new spell: how to shoot sticky spider web from your wand. You soon get the hang of swinging from the ceilings with the spider web silk.</p>
<p>The insects are treated better now. They are allowed to come and go as they please. Even Slumblebore has come around to the new order and can often be seen conversing with the great Azog in his office.</p>
<p>And you: you are content. You have come a long way since that first day when you flew into the Hogsnorts school hall. You rule Hogsnorts now, from the highest tower, and the insects are back on top.</p>
<p>CONGRATULATIONS - YOU HAVE ACHIEVED THE SCHOOL TAKEOVER ENDING!</p></p>
