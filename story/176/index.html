<p>"Yes there is something I need to talk to you about Arthur, something very important," says Slumblebore. 
</p><p>&quot;Ever since the end of the last school term I have sensed an evil presence in the school. An evil presence that is growing stronger by the day. All that I have been able to determine is that it is coming from the school dungeons. But <em>what</em> it is and <em>where</em> exactly it is down there I do not know. Whatever it is, is beyond my power.&quot;</p>
<p>Slumblebore peers at you closely, his bushy eyebrows raised.</p>
<p>&quot;This is where you come in Arthur. I need you to investigate what is going on in the dungeon. And deal with it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You want me to go to the dungeon!&quot; you ask, amazed. &quot;But you said at the school dinner that the dungeon was forbidden and no children were to go anywhere near!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes but Arthur don't you see? I can't just go around encouraging all the children to go down into the dungeons. There would be a stampede! And imagine if anything happened to them? Their parents would take Hogsnorts School to court, the fines could be crippling! No far better if you could just handle this quietly. And don't tell anyone that I told you to go down there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I know very little magic!&quot; you exclaim, &quot;I've only just started magic school!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I agree you should learn one or two spells before you venture down. Pay attention to your teachers! What they teach you could save your life.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But why me sir? Why not ask one of the older children to do it? Why don't <em>you</em> do it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There is one more thing I haven't told you Arthur. In the summer holidays I discovered an ancient prophecy concerning the school. It was written on a scroll that was so old that as soon as I touched it it turned to dust. It said:</p>
<p>'<em>When darkness falls across your school.
And evil threatens to rise and rule,<br>
When monsters lurk around school ground.
The boy called Arthur must be found.</em>'</p>
<p>&quot;Your coming has been foretold. If the prophecy is correct, only you can save us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And if you do this thing Arthur,&quot; Slumblebore adds, &quot;I will personally award one million points for Ravenwing House.&quot;</p><p></p>

<p>1. What must I do? you ask, with a determined look in your eye. ~ <strong><a href="/arthropods/story/234">Go to number 234</a></strong></p>
<p>2. "This is totally crazy," you exclaim. "You want me to fight an evil monster all on my own just because of some old poem? I'm just a kid!" As you leave the office Slumblebore calls after you: "I'll be here waiting for you Arthur, when you find your courage." ~ <strong><a href="/arthropods/story/267">Go to number 267</a></strong></p>
