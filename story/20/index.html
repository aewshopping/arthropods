<p>With a lump of fear in your throat you slowly walk down the wooden steps that take you deep down into the dark hole.
</p><p>What will you find down there? Everyone else emerged unscathed so it can't be dangerous can it? But will it be painful? What is this strange singing Percy creature?</p>
<p>You descend until all you can see above you is a circle of light and the noise of the hall fades to nothing.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello? Percy?&quot;</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>Then: &quot;Coo coo come closer, so I can see you better!&quot;</p>
<p>The voice emerging from the blackness in front of you has a strange high pitched musical quality to it. Fear closes your throat and you are rooted to the spot. Then... ouch! Something has bitten you on the bum! You see a small spider dropping off your robes and scurrying away into the darkness.</p>
<p>The pain in your bum gets you moving.</p>
<p>You slowly walk forwards wishing you could run back up the wooden steps to the safety of the hall above.</p>
<p>As you get closer you can just make out two round yellow eyes staring back at you, and between them a large... beak? Is Percy some kind of monster? Is he going to leap out at you and attack?</p>
<p>Your eyes adjust to the dark and you realise that you are staring at a gigantic pigeon, that's as tall as you are even sitting down.</p>
<p>&quot;Who are you?&quot; you ask.</p>
<p>&quot;Coo coo I'm Percy the Picking Pigeon and I will choose your house for you coo coo! Look into my eyes Arthur, look into my eyes...&quot;</p>
<p>You stare into the yellow eyes of the pigeon which seem to grow until they become the entire world.</p>
<p>&quot;Coo coo well, you're cowardly Arthur, coming here last in the line,&quot; says Percy. &quot;Maybe Hedgehog House is the one for you. Or maybe you are just a bit sneaky - and Snakefang House is best? Or perhaps hanging around last was a clever ploy? It does show that you can plan ahead, so Ravenwing maybe? But certainly not brave Lionpaw. Coo coo.&quot;</p>
<p>As Percy the Picking Pigeon probes your mind, you concentrate with all your being, repeating to yourself:</p><p></p>
