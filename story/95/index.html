Wesley the Weasel<br>
üçá</h1>
<div class="text-justify">
<p>As you reach out a hand to pat the weasel on the head, he bares his sharp teeth at you and hisses menacingly. You stop and look up at Slumblebore with a frown.
</p><p>&quot;Ah, I'm afraid that Wesley has taken a dislike to you. He's normally a very friendly and affectionate weasel but he hates all Snakefang House students and he can sniff them out instantly.&quot;</p>
<p>Slumblebore speaks sharply to his pet: &quot;Wesley! Come here boy! Here!&quot;</p>
<p>The weasel cowers and scampers over to the big desk, where it hops up, squats in the plate of raisins and chatters to itself.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, my weasel here has a rather sad history. Wesley was once a real boy, a student just like you Arthur,&quot; Slumblebore explains, &quot;until another pupil from Snakefang House cast a spell on him in a dispute about who had the fastest broomstick. The spell transformed him permanently into the weasel you see now - and gave Wesley an enduring hatred of all Snakefang House students.</p>
<p>At the mention of Snakefang, Weasley narrows his eyes malevolently and brazenly defecates onto the plate of raisins.</p>
<p>&quot;Because he was an orphan I felt the kindest thing I could do was to adopt him as my pet. I had that fetching red waistcoat and matching hat that he wears specially made for him by my tailor in Hippotomews. That was when I named him Wesley. Wesley the Weasel has a rather good ring to it, don't you think? His original boy name was Barry. Or possibly Gary.</p>
<p>&quot;Why do I tell you all this Arthur? I want you to know that for all my students I will always be there for them. I will always be there for you, when you need help the most. Always, Arthur, always. Metaphorically. Just like I was for Gary. Or was it Larry.</p><p></p>
