<p>The clock strikes one... two... three.
</p><p>The golden glow shining all around you gets stronger and stronger and soon you have to shut your eyes to the blinding golden light.</p>
<p>After a momentary sensation of vertigo, as if you have all of a sudden <em>fallen</em>, you sense that the golden light is fading away.</p>
<p>Opening your eyes you find you are at the bottom of a great stone well, with a circle of light far above. You realise that you have magically transported back to Percy the Picking Pigeon's hole in the Hogsnort's Great Hall, just as Slumblebore said you would. Somehow you know that you have also travelled back in time to before, when you had just arrived at the school. You are that Arthur once again in Percy's hole, but this time you can make a new choice.</p>
<p>&quot;Well Arthur,&quot; says a voice directly to your brain. &quot;What will you choose, coo coo.&quot; It is Percy the giant pigeon and you see again his giant yellow eyes staring at you.</p>
<p>This time you know you will make a good choice...</p><p></p>
