<p>The next day all the children are called to the school hall for a special announcement.
</p><p>As you take your seats at the house tables you notice that the ceiling has been enchanted to a beautiful sky blue with fluffy clouds scudding past on one side and a huge flock of Monarch butterflies on the other.</p>
<p>&quot;Students,&quot; announces Slumblebore from the front of the hall. &quot;I have a very special announcement. Yesterday, unbeknownst to us, we were threatened by a vast and evil insect horde gathering in the school dungeon.&quot;</p>
<p>Slumblebore casts a severe glance at professor Knid, who looks down sheepishly at the table.</p>
<p>&quot;We were saved thanks to the bravery, resourcefulness and cleverness of one boy.</p>
<p>&quot;That boy is Arthur Otley.&quot;</p>
<p>You feel your cheeks go red as all the students in the school turn round to get a look at you and you hear whispers of &quot;yes that's him&quot;, &quot;defeated the insects single handed, with his friend Daniel!&quot;, &quot;still just a first year!&quot;, and &quot;wouldn't mess with that fella!&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;In recognition of his outstanding services to Hogsnorts School I am pleased to award: one million points to Ravenwing House!&quot;</p>
<p>Deafening cheers come from the Ravenwings House students all around you.</p>
<p>&quot;Did you hear that?&quot; cries Daniel Colliers-Wood. &quot;A million points! Last year Ravenwing house only got 600 points for the whole year! Now no-one will be able to beat us to the House Cup!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Lastly I hereby announce a new order of wizardry: the Order of the Arthropods. The purpose of this order is to further the study of insects under magical enchantment. And we will start with the source of all the trouble: the spider king Azog himself!&quot;</p>
<p>The students cheer again as Slumblebore hands you a beautiful golden cage, with a still groggy Azog held prisoner within.</p>
<p>&quot;Three cheers for Arthur Otley, hero of the school and founding genius of the Order of the Arthropods!&quot;</p>
<p>With the cheers ringing in your ears you head straight for the magical laboratory with Daniel at your side, and Azog in his cage under your arm. Your head is full of all the insect related magical inventions you might create: enchanted chitin armour, spider silk swingers, acid blasters, who knows what else? With Azog to probe, you will be literally at the cutting edge of magical science and can't wait to see what you will learn!</p>
<p>CONGRATULATIONS - YOU HAVE ACHIEVED THE GENIUS OF THE SCHOOL ENDING</p><p></p>
