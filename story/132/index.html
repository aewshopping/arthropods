The Order of the Athropods<br>
<span class="text-size-x2">✊</span></h1>
<div>
<p>You hold out your hand to Azog and he puts his tiny spider legs on the tip of your finger. Looking into your eyes, he nods his head and climbs up onto your hand then up your arm and onto your shoulder.
</p><p>&quot;Athropods, prepare yourselves!&quot; shouts out Azog and out of the walls and ceiling untold millions of insects emerge, each one pitifully small but together forming a huge unstoppable army.</p>
<p>&quot;Today we have a new leader! He is the chosen one whose coming to the dungeon was foretold. He stands here before you: Arthur Otley!&quot;</p>
<p>Marvelling at the hordes of insects at your command you feel dizzy and excited. You realise that the insects of the world  <em>have</em> been overlooked and deserve justice - with you in charge. You raise your arm and clench your fist.</p>
<p>&quot;For too long has the insect world been downtrodden - literally - in this school,&quot; you say. &quot;From now on there will be a new house, above the four houses of Lionpaw, Ravenwing, Snakefang and Hedgehog. It will be a new Order to rule them! The Order of the Arthropods! First we will take over the school and then we will take over the world!&quot;</p>
<p>At the head of the insect army you and Azog pour out of the dungeon and into the school.</p>
<p>You stride into Slumblebore's office with Azog on your shoulder and millions of insects crawling on the floor, walls and ceiling just behind you.</p>
<p>Slumblebore is inside talking agitatedly to Snako. You quickly appraise them of their situation: you have a vast insect army, they don't.</p>
<p>Offering Snako a position as second in command of the Order of the Arthropods, he joins your side without a second's hesitation.</p>
<p>You offer Slumblebore to continue living at the school, but only if he resigns as headmaster and takes on a new role as janitor and personally cleans your house tower (without using magic) at least once a day. Otherwise he will be banished forever.</p>
<p>You also explain that there is a new fifth house now, the Order of the Arthropods, and from now on this house will win the house cup every year automatically - forever.</p>
<p>Slumblebore is reluctant, but he has no other option.</p>
<p>The next morning Slumblebore calls a general assembly of the school and announces the new order. The insect army is hidden in cracks in the walls but ready to leap out if necessary.</p>
<p>&quot;And so,&quot; Slumblebore concludes, &quot;Arthur Otley must now be obeyed by everyone. Furthermore, there is a new school rule: anyone caught stepping on a spider or squashing an ant will be imprisoned within the dungeon - for life.&quot;</p>
<p>There are shocked gasps around the room. Only now do they truly realise the new reality - the Order of the Arthropods has begun!</p><p></p>
