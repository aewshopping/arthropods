<p>"Let's go back to the House Tower," you say to Kensley. "I'm sleepy, it must be really late now."
</p><p>The two of you trudge wearily back to the Hedgehog House Tower. It is a long way but somehow you remember the path perfectly - perhaps due to some 'homing' magic that all Hogger's absorb when they first go to the Tower.</p>
<p>Before long you have found your way through the winding pathways and have gone <em>up</em> and <em>out</em> to the cool hillside where all the Hogger Holes are dug. You walk along the charming little path to your lovely green front door.</p>
<p>You feel your spirits lift: could anyone have a lovelier home to come back to than this?</p>
<p>&quot;Night night Arthur,&quot; says Kensley with a yawn as she pushes open her own front door. &quot;See you in the morning.&quot;</p>
<p>Throwing your robes over an armchair, you have a quick refreshing shower in your bathroom, dry yourself with an enormous fluffy white towel, climb into your cosy bed, and drift peacefully off to sleep.</p><p></p>
