The magical infinite<br>
<span class="text-size-x2">♾️</span></h1>
<div>
<p>Putting your hand into a stream of golden sparkles arcing by, you close your eyes and breathe slowly. 
</p><p>A sense of peace and serenity passes through you. You feel light, translucent: almost as if you have become one of the golden sparkles floating away.</p>
<p>Not floating <em>up</em> but somehow floating <em>through</em>, and you become aware of a subtle change in the air around you.</p>
<p>When you open your eyes you realise that you are now <em>outside</em> the infinite void that you had been floating in moments before.</p>
<p>In front of you is a large iridescent bubble, that has - impossibly but undeniably - wrapped up the infinite void that you were inside moments before. Peering closely through the bubble membrane, you can just make out the shimmering ribbons of golden magic arcing within it.</p>
<p>You realise that you have in some way gone <em>further up</em> and <em>further out</em>, onto another higher plane.</p>
<p>You notice other large iridescent bubbles floating around you.</p>
<p>One bubble in particular catches your eye.</p>
<p>In it you see another boy, about your age, with a mop of black hair, wizard robes and a peculiar scar on his forehead. Even though you have never met him before you feel you know who he is and a great feeling of warm friendliness comes over you.</p>
<p>Almost as if the boy in the bubble senses your thoughts he looks up and smiles.</p>
<p>You have a sudden insight that this place must be a place of almost infinite possibilities. Myriad bubbles fill the space around you - each bubble a different universe, each bubble a different possibility. You realise that together the bubbles must represent <em>every</em> possibility.</p>
<p>If you can imagine yourself in this place, you can be in any place.</p>
<p>You smile back at the boy with the funny scar on his forehead in the bubble next to you. Even though he can't see you, he must be able to sense you as you can sense him.</p>
<p>After contemplating the multiverse for a moment, or perhaps an eternity, you idly wonder whether you will head back to plane 42, or will you float out of and away from this story altogether?</p>
<p>CONGRATULATIONS YOU HAVE ACHIEVED THE INFINITE POSSIBILITIES ENDING. YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT! STOP HERE OR CONTINUE AND TURN TO ANY NUMBER...</p><p></p>
