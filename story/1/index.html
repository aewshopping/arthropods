The mysterious letter<br>
ðŸ“©</h1>
<div class="text-justify">
<p>"Arthur come here quick!" says Evan to you. "You've got a funny letter!"
<p>You yawn and get up from the breakfast table. You can see your little brother Evan holding a large old fashioned looking envelope that has just been posted through the front door.</p>
<p>&quot;Lemme see&quot; you say.</p>
<p>Sure enough on the front of the yellow-brown envelope is your name, Arthur Otley, written in spidery black ink. How curious. You turn the letter over and are surprised to see a big blob of red wax holding the envelope closed, not the normal spit-glue.</p>
<p>You don't get many letters and you have <em>never</em> got a letter that looked like this before. It looks like it was posted 100 years ago.</p>
<p>&quot;Morning my little munchkins!&quot; Dad cries out as he bounds down the stairs in his dressing gown. &quot;What's that you've got there Arthur?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's a letter, but... it looks a bit odd&quot; you reply.</p>
<p>&quot;Junk mail eh?&quot; says Dad.</p>
<p>Will you:</p></p>
</div>
<hr>
<p>1. Examine the envelope more carefully, perhaps it will reveal some clues about who sent it. ~ <strong><a href="/story/50" >Go to number 50</a></strong></p>
<p>2. Rip open the envelope immediately and see what's inside. ~ <strong><a href="/story/9" >Go to number 9</a></strong></p>
