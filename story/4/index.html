A spellbook puzzle<br>
<span class="text-size-x2">ðŸ“•</span></h1>
<div>
<p>You walk further into the book shop and spy a cheerful looking old witch wearing a black t-shirt with the word Watertomes on the back.
</p><p>&quot;Excuse me,&quot; you say &quot;Can you show me where the year 1 spellbook is?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Off to Hogsnorts are you young man?&quot; replies the old witch with a little cackle. &quot;Yes I can show you, follow me!&quot;</p>
<p>You and your mum follow the Watertomes witch as she shuffles off to the back of the bookshop. She picks up a heavy red book.</p>
<p>&quot;That will be 14 Frigates please.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah yes,&quot; replies your mum, &quot;We've only got pounds. Is that a problem?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well to tell the truth I don't really need money because I can magic up anything I like anyway. But I can't just give it to you for nothing... Tell you what, if you can solve my puzzle you can have it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What's the puzzle?&quot; you reply nervously, you never did like puzzles that much.</p>
<p>&quot;My lovely spell books are all about turning words into magic. And one of the magic things about words is that you can turn them into numbers.</p>
<p>For example the word CAB can turn into the number 6. C is the third letter of the alphabet, A is the first letter and B is the second. 3 + 1 + 2 = 6 so CAB turns into 6.</p>
<p>If you can magically turn my name into a number I will give you this book. My name is BOB. The old witch called Bob smiles at you encouragingly.</p>
<p>&quot;Hmmm let's see&quot; you say. As you are thinking the boy you saw at the front of the bookshop pushes a piece of paper into your hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Here!&quot; he says, &quot;this should help!&quot;</p>
<p>The piece of paper has all the letters of the alphabet next to their numbers:</p>
<p>A=1, B=2, C=3, E=4, D=5, F=6, G=7, H=8, I=9, J=10, K=11, L=12, M=13, N=14, O=15, P=16, Q=17, R=18, S=19, T=20, U=21, V=22, W=23, X=24, Y=25, Z=26</p><p></p>
</div>
<p class="text-centre">............................................................</p>
<p>1. You turn Bob's name into a number, and go to that number ~ <strong><a href="/arthropods/story/19">Go to the number of your answer</a></strong></p>
<p>2. You don't fancy maths right now - you go to get your magic wand ~ <strong><a href="/arthropods/story/5">Go to number 5</a></strong></p>
