Back to the Tower<br>
üèØ</h1>
<div class="text-justify">
<p>"Let's go back to the House Tower," you say to Snako. "I'm tired out, it must be really late now."
<p>The two of you trudge wearily back to the Snakefang House Tower. It is a long way but somehow you remember the path perfectly - perhaps due to some 'homing' magic that all Snakefang's absorb when they first go to the Tower.</p>
<p>Before long you have found your way through the winding pathways and are back next to the lava pool at the centre of Snakefang Tower. The glow of the lava lights everything up an eerie orange colour and Blood Drinker and the other giant snakes are basking next to the pool in the heat. Your nose catches a faint whiff of sulphur as you turn your head to follow the line of the stone staircase winding round the inside of this huge tower to the door of your own personal mini tower.</p>
<p>You feel your spirits lift: could anyone have a better home to come back to than this?</p>
<p>&quot;Night night Arthur,&quot; says Snako with a yawn. &quot;See you in the morning.&quot;</p>
<p>You both wearily climb the final stone staircase to your towers, unlock the doors with your wands, and enter.</p>
<p>Throwing your robes over the sofa, you have a quick refreshing shower in your bathroom, dry yourself with an enormous fluffy midnight-black towel, climb the spiral staircase to your cosy little bedroom at the top of your tower and drift peacefully off to sleep.</p></p>
