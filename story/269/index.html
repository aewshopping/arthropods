<div class="text-justify">
<p>You choose Offensive Magic with Professor Comicus Jape.
</p><p>You find the classroom after only a few wrong turns, and take a seat next to Aaron. You frown to see Snako Malboy from Snakefang class sitting down at the desk next to you. He notices you frowning and sneers back.</p>
<p>&quot;Now then children!&quot; Professor Jape calls out at the front of the class. &quot;Now then, now then! It's so lovely to meet you all.&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Jape is wearing a black cape with a red velvet lining and has a very pale almost white face. He smiles at the class warmly and gives a little wink.</p>
<p>&quot;Today we are going to learn some offensive magic. Now as you probably know offensive magic can be extremely dangerous. But that's not to say we can't have a bit of a laugh and a giggle as we go along eh? Eh children? Eh?&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Jape makes a loud high pitched giggling noise. Some of the other children laugh back nervously.</p>
<p>&quot;In fact I always like to break the ice with my new children with a joke. Hands up if you want to hear one of my jokes children.&quot;</p><p></p>
