The Order of the Athropods<br>
<span class="text-size-x2">✊</span></h1>
<div>
<p>You hold out your hand to Azog and he puts his tiny spider legs on the tip of your finger. Looking into your eyes, he nods his head and climbs up onto your hand then up your arm and onto your shoulder.
</p><p>&quot;Athropods, prepare yourselves!&quot; shouts out Azog and out of the walls and ceiling untold millions of insects emerge, each one pitifully small but together forming a huge unstoppable army.</p>
<p>&quot;Today we have a new leader! He is the chosen one whose coming to the dungeon was foretold. He stands here before you: Arthur Otley!&quot;</p>
<p>Marvelling at the hordes of insects at your command you feel dizzy and excited. You realise that the insects of the world  <em>have</em> been overlooked and deserve justice - with you in charge. You raise your arm and clench your fist.</p>
<p>&quot;For too long has the insect world been downtrodden - literally - in this school,&quot; you say. &quot;From now on there will be a new house, above the four houses of Lionpaw, Ravenwing, Snakefang and Hedgehog. It will be a new Order to rule them! The Order of the Arthropods!&quot;</p>
<p>At the head of the insect army you and Azog pour out of the dungeon and into the school.</p>
<p>You stride into Slumblebore's office with Azog on your shoulder and millions of insects crawling on the floor, walls and ceiling just behind you.</p>
<p>Slumblebore is inside talking agitatedly to Aaron. You quickly appraise them of their situation: you have a vast insect army, they don't.</p>
<p>Offering Aaron a position as second in command of the Order of the Arthropods, you are delighted when he agrees to join your side.</p>
<p>You offer Slumblebore to continue in his role as headmaster, but only if he acknowledges you as Supreme Governor, and accepts that the Order of the Arthropods will from now on win the House Cup every year forever. Otherwise you will instruct your insect hordes to take over by force.</p>
<p>Slumblebore is reluctant, but he has no other option. If insects are seen running amok in the school it will be terrible publicity and the parents will withhold their school fees.</p>
<p>The next morning Slumblebore calls a general assembly of the school and announces the new order. The insect's army is hidden in cracks in the walls but ready to leap out if necessary.</p>
<p>&quot;And so,&quot; Slumblebore concludes,&quot;Arthur Otley must now be obeyed by everyone. Furthermore, there is a new school rule: anyone caught stepping on a spider or squashing an ant will be imprisoned within the dungeon - for life.&quot;</p>
<p>There are shocked gasps around the room. Only now do they truly realise the new reality - the Order of the Arthropods has begun!</p><p></p>
