<p>You raise your hand and ask "Aren't ravens better than insects? They're much smarter for a start."
</p><p>&quot;Ravens! Pshaw. I would have thought that a Ravenwing student like you would be a bit smarter yourself! No boy, ravens are <em>not</em> better than insects.</p>
<p>&quot;Firstly: ravens may know how to fly but can't fly, but insects figured it out long before birds did. Insects have been flying for over 350 million years! But insects have been flying for twice as long as birds - birds only evolved 150 million years ago. Pathetic.</p>
<p>&quot;Secondly: a raven's cleverness is nothing compared even to an ant, who - working together - can build homes hundreds of times taller than they are. Skyscrapers! With air-conditioning, nurseries, storage chambers. And what is a raven's home? Just a pile of twigs. Rubbish.</p>
<p>&quot;Thirdly: how many ravens are there in the world? Not many I can tell you. Or how many birds even? 100 billion - at least that's what wikimagia says!</p>
<p>&quot;But how many insects are there in the world? 10 quintillion! That's 10 followed by 18 zeros. For every one pitiful bird on the earth there are 100 million amazing insects.</p>
<p>&quot;No, it is clear to me, as it should now be clear to you, that ravens are pitiful, almost inconsequential creatures compared to insects and arthropods.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But sir,&quot; interrupts Daniel, &quot;insects <em>are</em> a bit well, disgusting...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh the cheek of it! Who is to say that you are not disgusting to an insect young man? There will come a day - and maybe sooner than you think - when everyone will appreciate the magnificence of an insect, when people don't shudder when I brush past them with my cloak. Yes you will appreciate those 'disgusting' insects soon enough my boy.&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Jape paused and pinched the bridge of his nose with two fingers. &quot;Class dismissed. Your homework is to write an essay with the title 'What I love most about insects and arthropods'. Two thousand words minimum.&quot;</p><p></p>
