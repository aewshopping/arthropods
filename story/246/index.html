<p>You leap out of the clock just in time, you could already feel the magic sucking you down.
<p>Breathing hard you look back at the clock face and see the hands of the clock spinning madly backwards.</p>
<p>&quot;You have changed your mind about changing your mind have you?&quot; Slumblebore observes, his bushy eyebrows waggling. &quot;Well you can come and see me at any time and change your mind again if you want.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I... I... I think I don't want to leave Ravenwing just yet,&quot; you stammer. You are not quite sure why you changed your mind at the last minute, but it just didn't feel... right.</p>
<p>&quot;Well as you are not going anywhere just yet, let's get talking about the problem we have right now,&quot; says Slumblebore. &quot;I'm talking of course about what we are going to do about the evil presence in the school dungeon. I fear it is something that may threaten the very existence of Hogsnorts.&quot;</p></p>
