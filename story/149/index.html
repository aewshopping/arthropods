Slumblebore&#39;s office<br>
<span class="text-size-x2">üóÑÔ∏è</span></h1>
<div>
<p>Slumblebore's office is easy to find, you just follow the signs pointing the way. When you reach it you see that the door is slightly ajar - and there is a light still on inside. Perhaps Slumblebore has gone to bed and forgotten to turn the light out.
</p><p>You motion Kensley to wait outside and she nods vigorously. &quot;Be careful Arthur!&quot; she whispers, &quot;don't leave me on my own for too long!&quot;.</p>
<p>You push on the half open door and immediately hear a voice:</p>
<p>&quot;Come in Arthur.&quot; It's Slumblebore - you've been rumbled!</p>
<p>&quot;Don't worry,&quot; Slumblebore says as if reading your thoughts. &quot;I have been waiting for you to come. I wanted to talk with you.&quot;</p>
<p>You walk into Slumblebore's office and look around you. Every inch of space has been used. Leather bound books on bookshelves line the walls. Paintings with ornate golden frames are hung all around, and ancient Hogsnorts headteachers stare down at you, blinking and sniffing. From the ceiling hang silver cages containing magical golden birds, tiny jewelled monkeys no bigger than your thumb and baby dragons curled up and sleeping. On the floor pentagrams have been marked out in yellow chalk and you almost trip over a live weasel dressed in a little red waistcoat that must be Slumbebore's pet. You resist the urge to stroke its cute little furry head.</p>
<p>Slumblebore himself is sitting behind a massive wooden desk, piled high with manuscripts, scrolls, steaming goblets, plates of watermelon, little bowls of nuts and weasel droppings.</p>
<p>&quot;Care for a raisin?&quot; Slumblebore offers, brushing some weasel droppings onto the floor and proffering you a bowl.</p>
<p>&quot;Err no, thank you,&quot; you reply, not entirely convinced that the bowl is 100% raisins.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur, I'm glad you have come. There is something very serious for us to discuss, which concerns the safety of the entire school. I need your help. But first tell me, how are you settling into the school? Do you feel happy in your new house?&quot;</p><p></p>

<p>1. Yes it is very nice thank you, you reply. "But what did you want to talk to me about?" ~ <strong><a href="/arthropods/story/283">Go to number 283</a></strong></p>
<p>2. Well, I do like the school, you say. "But I'm not sure that I am in the right house. I don't feel like I really belong there." ~ <strong><a href="/arthropods/story/237">Go to number 237</a></strong></p>
<p>3. You reach out a hand to touch the weasel, it just looks so cute you can't help yourself. ~ <strong><a href="/arthropods/story/165">Go to number 165</a></strong></p>
