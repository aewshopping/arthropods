 Snako Malboy<br>
üêç</h1>
<div class="text-justify">
<p>"Hello," you say to the boy "my name's Arthur Otley and I'm going to Hogsnorts. Who are you?"
</p><p>The boy does his sneering smile at you again.</p>
<p>&quot;Snako Malboy. Yes I too am going to Hogsnorts. My father went to Hogsnorts. My grandfather went to Hogsnorts. So did his father and so on up to 72 generations and the founding of the school. Sylvester Snake - yes <em>the</em> Sylvester Snake is my direct ancestor. And my mother and their mothers too. So yes I am going to Hogsnorts.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who is Sylvester Snake?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sylvester Snake is only the founder of Snake House! The best house in the school. I'm going to be in Snake House. Snake House is for the really powerful wizards, like I will be one day. You will be in Hedgehog House I suppose.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I haven't decided yet&quot; you reply.</p>
<p>&quot;Well if you want to be Snake House like me you have to be strong and ruthless. Snake House rules yah sssssssss!&quot;</p>
<p>Snako Malboy stuck his tongue in and out of his mouth like a snake and hissed - not an easy thing to do at the same time. You are impressed.</p>
<p>At that point the magic tape measure is finished with Snako and moves over to you.</p><p></p>
