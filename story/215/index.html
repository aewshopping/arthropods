The Order of the Athropods<br>
<span class="text-size-x2">✊</span></h1>
<div>
<p>You realise that _this_ is your destiny, to command the insect horde, to lead them.
</p><p>You hold out your hand to Azog, who extends a spindly leg and climbs up your arm and onto your shoulder.</p>
<p>&quot;Well done Arthur&quot; says Azog, &quot;You have chosen... wisely.&quot;</p>
<p>Millions upon millions of insects are looking at you with their two, four or eight compound eyes, eyes on the sides of their heads, eyes on stalks, all waiting. Waiting for your command.</p>
<p>&quot;Insects!&quot; you exclaim. &quot;Arthropods! Follow me!&quot;</p>
<p>Looking back, the rest of that night seems more like a fantastic dream than reality.</p>
<p>You lead the insect army up through the passageways out of the dungeon and into the school. But instead of leading them to the centre of the school as Azog expected, you show them the way to Hedgehog House tower.</p>
<p>From there the whole streaming mass of ants, spiders, earwigs, woodlice and beetles emerges onto the cool night air of the hillside where the Hoggers live in their holes.</p>
<p>&quot;But Arthur,&quot; protests Azog. &quot;I thought we were taking over the school!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; you replied simply. &quot;Fighting only creates more fighting. Where will it end? What we need is peace.&quot;</p>
<p>You carry on walking, and hear the whispers of the insects as they follow you: &quot;peeece&quot; they say, &quot;peeeeeece&quot;.</p>
<p>Finally reaching the end of the lane of Hogger Holes you instruct them to dig.</p>
<p>Working together, before the sun has come up, the insects excavate a magnificent, glorious Hogger Hole of their own. While the door looks normal, and the initial tunnel is cosy enough to deceive the casual visitor - with umbrella stands and varnished wooden chairs with green velvet seats - soon the tunnel branches out into smaller and smaller passages, until they match the size of the insects that will live in them.</p>
<p>When the labour is complete, you turn to the tired, muddy, but happy insect multitude, and smile.</p>
<p>&quot;Insects,&quot; you say, &quot;welcome home.&quot;</p><p></p>
