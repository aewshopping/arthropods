<p>"What did you do that for?" you cry. "I thought he was your friend!"
</p><p>&quot;Eric King is... weak,&quot; replies Azog. &quot;His only purpose was to help me lure the chosen one - you - down here. Now that you have arrived, I no longer need him.&quot;</p>
<p>Azog stepped delicately over the snoring form of Professor King and advances towards you.</p>
<p>&quot;Just think Arthur. Together we could achieve so much. You, the chosen one with your one-of-a-kind wand and me with all the armies of the arthropods at my command! We could do anything. We could do everything!&quot;</p>
<p>While Azog is talking he is getting steadily closer and closer to you. You find yourself mesmerised by his eight tiny compound eyes.</p>
<p>Perhaps you <em>should</em> take a stand, remake the world with Azog and the insect hordes, take over the school... on the other hand if you were to stop Azog now you would be a hero and would surely win the house cup for Hedgehog House - didn't Slumblebore promise you a million points?</p>
<p>&quot;You must choose now Arthur,&quot; says Azog quietly. &quot;Are you with me? Or against me?&quot;</p><p></p>
