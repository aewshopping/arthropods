Down the toilet<br>
<span class="text-size-x2">ðŸš½</span></h1>
<div>
<p>You decide to go to the toilet - apart from anything else you do feel a bit nervous and it _is_ a good idea to have a wee before you get on the train.
</p><p>As you approach the station toilets you look down and are surprised to see five spiders walking in a line one after the other towards the disabled loo. Reasoning that this is not typical behaviour for spiders, and that anything weird might well be magical, you walk in the same direction.</p>
<p>Your reasoning is correct. As you approach the disabled toilet you are excited to see that the door is outlined in a magical golden glow. This must be the right place!</p>
<p>You push open the door and you, your Dad and Evan go inside. Inside you see... a normal toilet.</p>
<p>You look around for some sort of a clue but apart from a few discarded segments of toilet paper on the floor everything looks exactly as it should. Even the spiders are nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>&quot;Well it seems like this is a dead end Arthur, but you might as well do a wee now we're here.&quot; proposes Dad.</p><p></p>

<p>1. You disagree. You are not desperate, and decide instead to dash out and see if you can find that family of wizards you saw. ~ <strong><a href="/arthropods/story/14">Go to number 14</a></strong></p>
<p>2. He's right, you might as well do a wee now that you are in the toilet ~ <strong><a href="/arthropods/story/55">Go to number 55</a></strong></p>
