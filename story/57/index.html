Magical mayhem<br>
<span class="text-size-x2">ðŸ¦–</span></h1>
<div>
<p>You raise your wand, point it at the woodlice menacingly and shout loudly:
</p><p>&quot;Dispara dinosaurio demente!&quot;</p>
<p>From out of the end of your wand comes a faint but growing roaring sound, like an angry lion. The noise grows louder and louder until it is so loud it hurts your ears.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur, have you done?&quot; asks Kensley in alarm.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't...&quot; you begin, but before you can finish your sentence, a huge golden dinosaur head somehow <em>forces</em> it's way out of the tip of your wand, and roars again deafeningly.</p>
<p>&quot;ROAR!!!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh no, angry tyrannosaurus rexes are my number one fear!&quot; Kensley is too petrified to move.</p>
<p>But there's nothing you can do, the spell has been cast. The enormous magical t-rex squeezes its way out of your wand and charges its way towards the woodlice, waggling its ridiculous little front arms in a demented fashion.</p>
<p>It launches itself at the nearest woodlouse which has no time to react.</p>
<p>But instead of crushing the woodlouse in its banana sized teeth, the t-rex - impossibly - just bounces off.</p>
<p>It roars and tries again, with the same result.</p>
<p>Then it hits you - woodlice are completely immune to magic.</p>
<p>The dinosaur appears to understand this too. It looks around for a better target. And it's crazy little red eyes fix on you and Snako.</p>
<p>With a sense of horror you realise that the t-rex is now hunting <em>you</em>!</p>
<p>The rabid dinosaur leaps at you and Kensley but instead of eating you it flings you both into the stone wall on each side and you bump your head painfully. The t-rex stomps up the corridor before disappearing a puff of gold stars as the magic wears off.</p>
<p>As you slide down the wall and into unconsciousness, you can see the millions of woodlice waving their little antennae. As you close your eyes you think: are they laughing?</p><p></p>
