The dungeon door<br>
<span class="text-size-x2">ðŸšª</span></h1>
<div>
<p>As the other Lionpaw students file off into the corridor on their way to Lionpaw House tower you and Aaron quietly slip away to the side. After two or three turns of the passageway the noise of the other students has faded to nothing.
</p><p>&quot;Now where?&quot; asks Aaron.</p>
<p>You look around trying to get your bearings. You realise that the school is absolutely huge. There must be hundreds of corridors, archways, passageways and staircases. How will you even find the way to the dungeons?</p>
<p>Just then you notice five spiders walking along the floor, lined up one after the other. How odd, you think and start to follow them along the corridor.</p>
<p>They turn left, right, right again, then left before disappearing under a crack in the doorway.</p>
<p>You look up. Above the door is a sign scrawled in thick black letters: DUNGEONS.</p>
<p>&quot;We've made it,&quot; you whisper to Aaron, afraid to speak too loud in the silence. You reach out to turn the great brass doorknob and open the door. But it doesn't budge, and as you pull on the doorknob the edge of the door glows golden.</p>
<p>&quot;Look!&quot; says Aaron to you quietly, &quot;the door is enchanted. We'll never open it if we don't know the magic password.&quot;</p>
<p>At that moment you hear lots of footsteps coming your way from around a corner. It must be a group of students on their way to their house tower! Before you have time to hide, they turn the corner and spot you.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur and Aaron isn't it? What are you doing there? Come on get back into line!&quot; To your surprise you are addressed by one of the older Lionpaw students. You must have somehow taken a hidden shortcut when following the spiders.</p><p></p>
</div>
<p class="text-centre">............................................................</p>
<p>1. You slink back into the line and head off into the passageway with the rest of the students. You glance back at the dungeon door as you walk away and whisper over your shoulder: "We'll be back!" ~ <strong><a href="/arthropods/story/219">Go to number 219</a></strong></p>
