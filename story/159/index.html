<p>"I'm Arthur Otley and I want to learn some spells" you say to Professor Blavatsky.
</p><p>&quot;Ah so impatient. And yet this impatience stops you learning about yourself. I can see that you are very far from self control as yet.&quot;</p>
<p>The teacher stands up and raises one hand.</p>
<p>&quot;But do not worry, any of you. Because we will start with a simple meditation session to help you gain control.&quot;</p>
<p>You groan inwardly. This sounds boring.</p>
<p>&quot;Close your eyes everyone,&quot; begins Professor Blavatsky. &quot;Make sure you are comfortable in your seats. Now I want you to focus on your breathing. Breathe in. Breathe out. Breathe in... and breathe out.</p>
<p>&quot;Feel the breath flowing into your nostrils. Concentrate on the sensation. Do you feel your nose hairs tickling? Perhaps a small bogey flapping around in your nasal passage? Just think about the breath, how it feels.&quot;</p>
<p>Despite yourself you feel your awareness sharpening, and you do indeed feel a small bogey in your nostril wobbling around as you breathe in and out.</p>
<p>&quot;Now I want you to think about a special number. The special number is 42. A four and then a two. Forty two. This number is not just a number it is also a place. A location. A place of calm that you can always turn to in moments of difficulty or stress.</p>
<p>&quot;This number 42 is a place within yourself, but it is a real place too that anyone can reach, if they just turn to that number... the number 42. As you turn to 42, just keep your thumb here so you know where to come back to.&quot;</p>
<p>Amazingly you feel a sensation as if you are floating somehow, except with your thumb stuck down in front of you. Concentrating fiercely you try with all your might to turn to 42. You float away...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&quot;Did anyone manage to meditate and reach 42?&quot; asks Madam Blavatsky.</p>
<p>You definitely feel you went... somewhere. You <em>think</em> this is what Professor Blavatsky meant.</p>
<p>&quot;Any time you find yourself in need of quiet and peace, just repeat this meditation exercise and think of the number 42 and you will find a place of calm and relaxation - but keep your thumb right where you are and you will be able to turn back whenever you want.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Class dismissed! We will meet again.&quot;</p><p></p>
