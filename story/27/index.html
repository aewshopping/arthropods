The flying car<br>
<span class="text-size-x2">ðŸš—</span></h1>
<div>
<p>Mr Bleezeley gives his little blue car a proud tap on the bonnet. "She may not be the Hogsnorts Express," he says, "but this fine car will have you there in a jiffy, with a fair wind."
</p><p>You are in the station carpark, all standing next to the Bleezeleys' car.</p>
<p>&quot;Dad's enchanted the car to be able to fly,&quot; explains Aaron Bleezeley, &quot;so in <em>theory</em> we should be able to follow the train from above and get to Hogsnorts that way.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There's just one problem though Dad,&quot; says Robert Bleezeley, the oldest child. &quot;There's only room for four people in this car. If me, Alex, Aaron and also Arthur are going there's no room for you or Mum. We won't all fit.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't worry,&quot; says Mr Bleezeley, &quot;I'll just cast a spell on the sat nav to fly you there automatically, and then you can go by yourselves. Dad and I will stay here. Come on, in you get boys!&quot;</p>
<p>Robert and Alex get in the front seats and you and Aaron in the back.</p>
<p>Mr Bleezeley draws his magic wand, and gently raps the windscreen: &quot;<em>Fly, fly, fly up high, get to Hogsnorts through the sky.</em>&quot;</p>
<p>He lowers his wand and smiles at them. &quot;That should do the trick. Stand back everyone.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bye bye Arthur!&quot; shout your Dad and Evan, as the car engine splutters into life. &quot;Good luck!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bye bye Dad, bye bye Evan!&quot; you reply as the car starts moving forward and <em>upward</em> into the sky. &quot;See you later!&quot;</p>
<p>You watch the ground drop away beneath you in amazement as the car roars through the air.</p>
<p>Turning to the boys in the car with you: Aaron, Alex and Robert you:</p><p></p>
