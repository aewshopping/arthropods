Woodlouse warfare<br>
ðŸª–</h1>
<div class="text-justify">
<p>"Somnolencia salchicha sabrosa," you cry, waving your wand about energetically.
<p>You feel a tingly sensation waft down your arm and out through your wand. A beautiful shower of golden sparks pours out from the tip and arcs down the corridor raining down onto the three beetles.</p>
<p>Each beetle glows gold for an instant before slowly rolling onto their side and then their backs, six legs waggling gently in the air.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you think they are ok?&quot; asks Kensley.</p>
<p>&quot;They... they seem to be. That was a sleeping spell. Look you can see their legs are still moving.&quot;</p>
<p>They must be dreaming some pleasant beetle dream, perhaps of cantering through a leafy carboniferous glade, as their legs make little wiggles in the air.</p>
<p>&quot;Come on Kensley, let's tip toe past them before they wake up.&quot;</p>
<p>You and Kensley carefully walk around the sleeping beetles.</p>
<p>You descend a spiral staircase now and the air is getting dank and stale. It can't be long before you arrive in the dungeon.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the staircase it is pitch black.</p>
<p>You raise your wand and the tip emits a faint golden light, just enough to see by.</p>
<p>You can't stop yourself emitting an involuntary gibber.</p>
<p>Revealed by the dim light of your wand you can see the floor and the walls are completely covered in woodlice. Millions upon millions of them cling to the damp stone slabs that make up the corridor. Millions more cover the flagstones, waving their repulsive little antennae. Others have curled up into balls and are rolling around irresponsibly.</p>
<p>Do woodlice even have eyes? You don't know but when you turned on your light they all seemed to turn and look at you.</p>
<p>&quot;Holy hedgehogs!&quot; says Kensley, a tremor of fear in her voice. &quot;Arthur, what are we going to do? There is no way we can get past so many of them!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Try not to panic Kensley&quot; you say in reply. &quot;I have an idea.&quot;</p></p>

<p>1. You chant the spell "Fiel fresa fusila fuego." ~ <strong><a href="/story/233" >Go to number 233</a></strong></p>
<p>2. You recite the incantation "Amansa atÃºn!" ~ <strong><a href="/story/111" >Go to number 111</a></strong></p>
<p>3. You shout out "Dispara dinosaurio demente!" ~ <strong><a href="/story/57" >Go to number 57</a></strong></p>
<p>4. You decide that you will just walk forwards, over the woodlice. ~ <strong><a href="/story/161" >Go to number 161</a></strong></p>
