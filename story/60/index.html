The sorting song<br>
<span class="text-size-x2">ðŸŽ¤</span></h1>
<div>
<p>A warbling tune floats into the hall from the hole: 
</p><div class="text-poem">
<p>&quot;<em>First years, first years, what will you do?<br>
Which House do you like and which House likes you?<br>
I've written this ditty while waiting in my hole<br>
Listen very closely and figure out your role...</em></p>
<p><em>Leonard Lionpaw he fights for truth<br>
With boot and fist, nail and tooth.<br>
When injustice triumphs it makes him sick<br>
He'll fight right back with a punch and a kick.</em></p>
<p><em>Rebecca Ravenwing, her mind's so quick,<br>
She makes even Albert Einstein look a bit thick.<br>
When evil lurks she knows just what to do:<br>
Outwit the wicked witch with her brainbox crew.</em></p>
<p><em>Helen Hedgehog, she's reliable and calm<br>
She'll never start trouble or cause you harm.<br>
With bad magic in the air, she'll act fast:<br>
She'll hide and curl up until the danger is past.</em></p>
<p><em>Sylvester Snakefang, seeking world domination<br>
Power is his thing along with extirpation.<br>
When darkness comes his eyes light up,<br>
He'll do anything it takes to make it to the top.</em>&quot;</p>
</div>
<p>The song warbles to a stop and there is smattering of polite applause from the children in the hall.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you Percy,&quot; says Slumblebore, directing his voice down into the hole. &quot;Although I must say I thought last year's song was better.&quot;</p>
<p>Percy? What is this strange singing creature called Percy living in a hole underneath the Great Hall? you ask yourself.</p>
<p>&quot;First years, please form a queue in front of me!&quot;</p>
<p>You realise that you are soon going to find out whoever or whatever Percy is. You nervously stand up along with all the other first years. You decide to:</p><p></p>
</div>
<p class="text-centre">............................................................</p>
<p>1. Go to the front of the queue. Whatever happens you want to be first in line to see! ~ <strong><a href="/arthropods/story/7">Go to number 7</a></strong></p>
<p>2. Lurk around at the back of the queue. Fortune favours the prudent. ~ <strong><a href="/arthropods/story/13">Go to number 13</a></strong></p>
