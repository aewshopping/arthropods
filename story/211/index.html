<p>"You're right Aaron, let's just chillax round here for today. We can also catch up on lessons tomorrow."
</p><p>Aaron grins. &quot;Chillax it is. Get your swimming trunks Arthur, and let's check out the steam room!&quot;</p>
<p>You race back to your bedroom, change into your swimming trunks and grab a fluffy white Lionpaw monogrammed towel.</p>
<p>After a few minutes relaxing in the steam room, you decide to see what is in the room marked &quot;Infinity Pools&quot;, and are delighted to find a huge sloped area full of different temperature pools, each one flowing into another. In each pool is a collection of enchanted bath toys: rubber ducks that swim around, plastic fish that jump from pool to pool and playful sponges that throw themselves.</p>
<p>When you are bored with this you head to the Virtual reality gaming room. You and Aaron lose yourself for a couple of hours playing virtual reality tennis and ten-pin bowling.</p>
<p>After a spell riding the giant floor cleaning snails around the common room in slow motion races, you spend the rest of the day in the Lionpaw House Tower waterpark, sliding down the slides, surfing on the wave machine, or sailing miniature pirate ships and firing the water cannons at each other.</p>
<p>Finally you and Aaron are both exhausted and you go to the main common room to relax on a sofa. After a while the other Lionpaw students arrive from their lessons.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey Arthur, Aaron,&quot; shouts one. &quot;Don't you know it is dinner time?&quot; </p><p></p>

<p class="text-centre">............................................................</p>
<p>1. You head off to the Hognsorts great hall for dinner with the other students. ~ <strong><a href="/arthropods/story/196">Go to number 196</a></strong></p>
<p>2. You are too exhausted after your hard day's play - you decide to go to bed instead. ~ <strong><a href="/arthropods/story/153">Go to number 153</a></strong></p>
