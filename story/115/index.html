<div>
<p>You remember that woodlice are one of the few creatures that are completely immune to magic of any kind, and decide to cast a heat spell to clear a path indirectly. 
</p><p>You raise your wand. &quot;Fiel fresa fusila fuego!&quot;</p>
<p>A magical flame whooshes out of your wand, sending golden sparks shooting.</p>
<p>The flame doesn't harm the woodlice, but it heats the air, and dries it. The woodlice have no option but to retreat: without moisture they can't absorb oxygen, they would suffocate.</p>
<p>This leaves a path.</p>
<p>&quot;Wait!&quot; says Aaron. &quot;I... I can't go any further.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What's wrong?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's the woodlice. I have had a terrible fear of them ever since one rolled up my nose as a baby. I can't... I just can't go on.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Listen Aaron, it's ok. I'll keep going but you should turn back and tell Slumblebore what we have found down here: the spider webs, the beetles, the woodlice. He needs to know what's going on.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, yes... thank you Arthur. Slumblebore needs to know,&quot; says Aaron in relief. &quot;I'll go and get help.&quot;</p>
<p>Aaron turns and hot-foots it back the way you came.</p>
<p>As his hurried footsteps fade into the distant darkness, you breathe deeply and plunge forwards past the woodlouse army who are retreating to the still moist cracks in the stone.</p>
<p>After walking further down the dank, chilly passage you come to an iron bar door.</p>
<p>Just beyond you can hear a faint murmur of voices.</p>
<p>This is it: the heart of the dungeon. Whoever or whatever has been setting these traps for you and Aaron must be here, at the bottom of it all.</p><p></p>
