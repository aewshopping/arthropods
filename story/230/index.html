The dungeon door<br>
<span class="text-size-x2">ðŸšª</span></h1>
<div>
<p>You enter the passageway sloping downwards and after many twists and turns in the passageway you are hopelessly lost.
</p><p>You notice a charming little spider running around a corner ahead of you. Curiously it then comes back round the corner, looks at you and waits, then lifts up a spindly leg and points.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur&quot; says Kensley, &quot;I think that charming little little spider wants us to follow him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not sure if we should really be doing this...&quot; you say. &quot;But Let's see where it goes.&quot;</p>
<p>You follow the spider as it turns this way then that and are delighted to finally arrive at what must surely be the entrance to the dungeon.</p>
<p>A huge wooden door, banded with iron and patterned with silver swirls, stands within a stone archway. Either side of the door two antique sets of armour are positioned upright as if on guard.</p>
<p>The spider you were following scurries through the keyhole of the door and disappears.</p>
<p>Above the door there is a sign written in some archaic font, which reads: &quot;DUNGEON&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur!&quot; Kensley exclaims, &quot;I think this may be the door to the dungeon!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You may be onto something Kensley&quot;, you reply. &quot;But don't get carried away <em>just</em> yet.&quot;</p>
<p>You try the doorknob... but it doesn't budge.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a magical enchantment of locking on the door!&quot; says Kensley. &quot;We will need to cast a counter spell if we are to get through.&quot;</p>
<p>As you lift up your wand, you rack your brains to try to think of a spell that might work.</p><p></p>
