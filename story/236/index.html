The wake up call<br>
⏰</h1>
<div class="text-justify">
<p>You wake up and for a moment you can't remember where you are. Then slowly it comes back to you: you are in your own underground home set into the side of a hill which you have reached by ascending an enchanted teleportation tower in Hogsnorts School of Magic. You are in the best house - Hedgehog House - and you have a new best friend - Kensley Potato.
<p>You sigh with happiness. Yes, life is good right now.</p>
<p>But that reminds you: Kensley! She had her own Hogger-hole next door. You throw on your clothes as quickly as you can and dash down your tunnel to find her.</p>
<p>Just as you are running out of your door, you see Kensley dashing out of her door to come and find you.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthur!&quot; she says, &quot;isn't this place so nice? I've got my own house in the hillside with polished chairs and pegs and everything!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But listen,&quot; she continues, not giving you the chance to reply. &quot;Why don't we stay here for the day instead of going for lessons? I'm sure no-one would notice if we weren't there. And I want to have a look around here first.&quot;</p></p>
</div>

<p>2. "Yes ok," you say. "And I'm sure you're right, no-one will notice if we don't turn up ." ~ <strong><a href="/story/273" >Go to number 273</a></strong></p>
