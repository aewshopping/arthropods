Beetle battle<br>
<span class="text-size-x2">ðŸª²</span></h1>
<div>
<p>You find yourself face to face with a trio of bombardier beetles, who seem to be guarding the way. 
</p><p>&quot;Wow look at the size of those things!&quot; says Aaron. &quot;Do you think they are friendly.&quot;</p>
<p>One of them makes an angry chittering sound. Even though you don't speak beetle you are pretty sure this beetle doesn't like you.</p>
<p>The three beetles turn around in the corridor to face away from you.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey look they're running away!&quot; shouts Aaron.</p>
<p>Suddenly there is a loud popping sound and a steam of superheated liquid shoots out of the beetles' bottoms.</p>
<p>&quot;Duck!&quot; you cry, and you and Aaron throw yourself to one side. The liquid misses you by inches. The stone flagstone bubbles and fizzes where the liquid struck it.</p>
<p>You both pick yourself up off the floor and scramble back round the corner for safety.</p>
<p>&quot;That was too close,&quot; you say. &quot;We need to find a way to get past those things.&quot;</p>
<p>You think hard, there must be a spell that you can use. Some spell that puts them out of action for a while so you can sneak past.</p>
<p>After a moment, with grim determination, you decide. You leap out from your hiding place, your wand at the ready.</p><p></p>

<p>5. This is all getting a bit hairy, you decide that the best course of action will be to retreat and come back tomorrow, having learnt some anti-beetle spells. ~ <strong><a href="/arthropods/story/120">Go to number 120</a></strong></p>
