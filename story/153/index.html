Wake up call<br>
⏰</h1>
<div class="text-justify">
<p>You wake up feeling refreshed and content. You wonder why you are feeling so cheerful and then you remember: you are a pupil in the Hogsnorts school of magic, and have been chosen for the best house - Lionpaw. You have already made a good friend, Aaron Bleezely, and you have your own four-poster bed with an ensuite bathroom. Life is looking good!
<p>You jump out of bed and pull on your wizard's robes.</p>
<p>&quot;Aaron&quot; you shout as you walk out onto the staircase, &quot;are you up?&quot;</p>
<p>At that moment you see Aaron running up the stairs towards you in his swimming trunks.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey Arthur, you woke up at last! I've been playing in the waterslides for the last hour. The Lionpaw House Tower is soooo cool. What shall we do today? I know there are lessons but I'm sure no-one will notice if we skip them for a day.&quot;</p></p>
</div>
<hr>
<p>1. You explain to Aaron that your really want to learn some magic spells and that you can do waterslides together some other time. ~ <strong><a href="/story/225" >Go to number 225</a></strong></p>
<p>2. He's got a point you think. Magic school will last for six years. Surely bunking off for one day won't do any harm? ~ <strong><a href="/story/211" >Go to number 211</a></strong></p>
