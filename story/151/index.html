Dinner time<br>
üçΩÔ∏è</h1>
<div class="text-justify">
<p>Joining a gang of other Snakefang students you head off on the long winding route back to the Hogsnorts Great Hall to get your dinner.
<p>You take a seat at the Snakefang table (after a minor scuffle with some thick headed Lionpaw students) and look around amazed.</p>
<p>Tonight Slumblebore has enchanted the walls and ceiling of the Great Hall to look like the sub-tropical, volcano strewn world of the Jurassic. The effect is made even more magical by enchanting the floor to make it appear as if the Great Hall is strapped to the back of a huge lumbering sauropod - a brontosaurus perhaps - the chairs ensorcelled to vibrate with every lumbering step.</p>
<p>You stare wide eyed at the other giants of the sauropod herd to your left and ride, their long necks stretching forward as you cross an ancient Jurassic plain.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't forget to eat Arthur!&quot; Snako reminds you, elbowing you in the side.</p>
<p>You look down to see yet another incredible feast.</p>
<p>An entire flock of roast swans laid out in a row along the long table. Huge piles of frankfurter sausages, sizzled a beautiful golden brown. Crispy potato chips carved into all manner of spirals, whorls, and helixes. Pears smothered in mayonnaise. Baked bananas wrapped in delicious streaky bacon, stuffed with ketchup. Profiteroles the size of your head, full of light fluffy cream.</p>
<p>It is all so delicious you can't stop an involuntary slobber which you quickly wipe from your chin with the table cloth.</p>
<p>You cram food into your mouth and gulp it down.</p>
<p>When you are full you have a brisk food fight with Lionpaw table, pelting them with profiteroles and bread soaked in gravy - they return the attack with giant strawberries and chicken drumsticks. You shout with laughter when you hit one of the Lionpaw students, a boy called Aaron, full on the face with a giant profiterole and cream explodes everywhere. Snako gets hit in the eye with a boiled potato.</p>
<p>The food fight ends when the dinosaur enchantment on the walls and ceiling suddenly transforms into a battle scene as a gang of huge tyrannosaurus rexes charge from the side at the sauropods that you are riding. You scream and shout with the other students - Slumbledore's enchantment looks so real you can't help ducking as a huge t-rex slashes at you with claws the size of hockey sticks.</p>
<p>Chairs are leaning crazily as the sauropod carrying the Dining Hall tries to evade the ferocious T-Rex attack. The sauropods moan distress cries and fight back with tail whips and neck slams. Several Hedgehog House students vomit on the floor, overcome with fright and motion sickness.</p>
<p>It's complete pandemonium, which ends with the T-Rexes fleeing, defeated but blood dripping from their jaws where they have bitten off hunks of sauropod flesh.</p>
<p>&quot;Snakehouse rules yah ssss!&quot; shouts Snako at the top of his voice at the retreating T-Rexes, overcome with excitement, sticking out his tongue and flapping his hands by the side of his head.</p>
<p>This signals the end of the best dinner you have ever had.</p>
<p>Turning to Snako you say.</p></p>
