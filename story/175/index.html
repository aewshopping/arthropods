<p>Making sure that you have got all of your quills, ink bottles, spell books and sweets, you put your bag on your shoulder and leave the Great Hall to go back to the House Tower with Snako.
<p>Strangely enough you find you can remember the way back there easily - the path had seemed so long and winding on your first day. Perhaps it was something to do with eating the Snakefang Egg from Percy the Picking Pigeon that has given you a homing instinct for the Tower.</p>
<p>When you arrive you head straight to the Snakefang house sauna and get a wonderful massage from one of the giant snakes, who slithers around on your back while you lie down.</p>
<p>Refreshed you pop your robes back on, give the snake a pat on the head, and turn to Snako.</p></p>

<p>1. Let's go get some dinner, I'm absolutely famished. ~ <strong><a href="/story/151" >Go to number 151</a></strong></p>
<p>2. "I'm not hungry today, I'm just going to get some rest so I am fresh for the morning." With that you retire to your en-suite bedroom, snuggle under the duvet and quickly fall fast asleep. ~ <strong><a href="/story/213" >Go to number 213</a></strong></p>
